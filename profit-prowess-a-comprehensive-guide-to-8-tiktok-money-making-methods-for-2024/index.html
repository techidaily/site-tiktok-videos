<p><strong>1. Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events</strong></p>
<p>TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website’s header.</p>
<p>Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.</p>
<p><strong>2. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them</strong></p>
<p>Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs. After that, develop lookalikes of those audiences.</p>
<p>The similar will come in handy when you’re making target audiences for such campaigns, and you’ll be able to eliminate some of your groups of ads to allow better waste management.</p>
<p><strong>3. Create Target Audiences that Aren’t Too Small</strong></p>
<p>There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That’s a considerable number, though!</p>
<p>On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.</p>
<p><strong>4. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind</strong></p>
<p>You’re interrupting someone’s feed with a brand ad that the user didn’t ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.</p>
<p><strong>5. Use Excellent Tool to Create Ads</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use app for editing videos. We highly recommend it for editing perfect ads for TikTok.

<p><strong>1. Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events</strong></p>
<p>TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website’s header.</p>
<p>Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.</p>
<p><strong>2. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them</strong></p>
<p>Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs. After that, develop lookalikes of those audiences.</p>
<p>The similar will come in handy when you’re making target audiences for such campaigns, and you’ll be able to eliminate some of your groups of ads to allow better waste management.</p>
<p><strong>3. Create Target Audiences that Aren’t Too Small</strong></p>
<p>There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That’s a considerable number, though!</p>
<p>On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.</p>
<p><strong>4. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind</strong></p>
<p>You’re interrupting someone’s feed with a brand ad that the user didn’t ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.</p>
<p><strong>5. Use Excellent Tool to Create Ads</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use app for editing videos. We highly recommend it for editing perfect ads for TikTok. With this editing software app, you can add logos, images, and creative videos at any position.

<p><strong>1. Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events</strong></p>
<p>TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website’s header.</p>
<p>Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.</p>
<p><strong>2. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them</strong></p>
<p>Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs. After that, develop lookalikes of those audiences.</p>
<p>The similar will come in handy when you’re making target audiences for such campaigns, and you’ll be able to eliminate some of your groups of ads to allow better waste management.</p>
<p><strong>3. Create Target Audiences that Aren’t Too Small</strong></p>
<p>There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That’s a considerable number, though!</p>
<p>On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.</p>
<p><strong>4. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind</strong></p>
<p>You’re interrupting someone’s feed with a brand ad that the user didn’t ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.</p>
<p><strong>5. Use Excellent Tool to Create Ads</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use app for editing videos. We highly recommend it for editing perfect ads for TikTok. With this editing software app, you can add logos, images, and creative videos at any position.

<p>Marc Jacobs mastered the art of TikTok duets and TikTok brand campaigns and propelled it to be one of the most followed brands on TikTok. The question is, how did this come to pass? The company launches branded Hashtag Challenges in the form of TikTok adverts, and each time, the TikTok duet feature is utilized. Their #PerfectAsIAm campaign, which constituted duets with Rickey Thompson and other three influencers in summer 2020, ended with 10.4B views. The brand followed up with a second #PerfectAsWeAre campaign in June 202. The challenge aimed at encouraging self-love, celebrating pride and individuality. Three massive TikTok influencers JojoSiwa, Bretman Rock, and Rickey Thompson, were featured. Over 13.7 B views and more than 2,000K U.G.C. accumulated from their campaigns.</p>

<p>Dunkin is undoubtedly one of the best food brands on TikTok. It has more than 21 million likes and over three million followers. Its popularity with Gen Z on TikTok comes from their endorsement with TikTok star Charli D’Amelio.</p>
<p>In a smart move, a long-term sponsorship with Charli solidified their influence since he was already a proud Dunkin’ patron. Dunkin’ beverages appeared in over 120 of her TikToks, mostly unsponsored products.</p>

<p><strong>1. Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events</strong></p>
<p>TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website’s header.</p>
<p>Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.</p>
<p><strong>2. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them</strong></p>
<p>Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs. After that, develop lookalikes of those audiences.</p>
<p>The similar will come in handy when you’re making target audiences for such campaigns, and you’ll be able to eliminate some of your groups of ads to allow better waste management.</p>
<p><strong>3. Create Target Audiences that Aren’t Too Small</strong></p>
<p>There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That’s a considerable number, though!</p>
<p>On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.</p>
<p><strong>4. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind</strong></p>
<p>You’re interrupting someone’s feed with a brand ad that the user didn’t ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.</p>
<p><strong>5. Use Excellent Tool to Create Ads</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use app for editing videos. We highly recommend it for editing perfect ads for TikTok. With this editing software app, you can add logos, images, and creative videos at any position. There are multiple filters, effects, and elements you can choose from to make perfect edits on TikTok campaigns.</p>
