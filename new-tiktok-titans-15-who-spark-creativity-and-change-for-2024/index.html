Take a video with a trending song or audio</h3><p>First, you have to know what’s trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p>

Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list.

Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="4.
