<h4 id="Tip-1-Adding-Tags"><a href="#Tip-1-Adding-Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Adding Tags"></a>Tip 1: Adding Tags</h4><p>Adding Tags sounds simple. However, it gives unprecedented results for your TikTok account and posted videos. What you need to do is, at the end of the post (or in the middle also), you need to put some valuable hashtags (the symbol “# followed by a short text without space”), which tells about your video genre. So, whenever any user clicks on the particular hashtags, those users will directly be able to see your video content, media file, or will get directed to your content area. Thus, giving your post a boost. Hence this is how to get views on TikTok.</p>
<h4 id="Tip-2-Actively-involved-At-least-one-post-per-day"><a href="#Tip-2-Actively-involved-At-least-one-post-per-day" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day"></a>Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day</h4><p>You must be aware of the idea of activeness. Whoever remains active wins the race. The fact behind is, if you actively engage in posting the content over your TikTok account, then the users will feel the sense of connection, and the chain reaction will increase the size of followers day by day.</p>
<p>Further, be consistent in posting at least one post per day. It will reflect your keen interest in the TikTok profile.</p>
<h4 id="Tip-3-‘For-You’-page"><a href="#Tip-3-‘For-You’-page" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: ‘For You’ page"></a>Tip 3: ‘For You’ page</h4><p>Another valuable trick is to involve&#x2F;include the front page, ‘For You’ page for the users. It will direct and suggest the users’ relevant link, content, or video of their interests according to their search history. So, when any user lands on your page, they will get the content of interest, enhancing their chances of revisiting your profile. Also, you will get an idea of what is the most liked video on TikTok.</p>
<h4 id="Tip-4-Collaborate-with-your-friends"><a href="#Tip-4-Collaborate-with-your-friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends"></a>Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends</h4><p>Preparing a video or media for the TikTok profile is a good idea, but posting some exciting content along with your friend is a beautiful idea. That will double the chance of getting the more viewer list of your TikTok account. Even you will see that taking the collaboration or help of your friends to create the content will make the video more interactive and exciting.</p>
<h4 id="Tip-5-Interaction-with-TikTok-users-with-comments"><a href="#Tip-5-Interaction-with-TikTok-users-with-comments" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments"></a>Tip 5: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments</h4><p>Your users are the real source for the promotion of your profile in the TikTok world and to know how to get more views and likes on TikTok. So better be involved with them as much as possible. Actively write comments, so whenever a user visits your profile, they see that you write comments regularly, and most probably revert to your account or profile.</p>

Launched in 2020, the TikTok creator fund is the opportunity of a lifetime for determined video creators to earn per view on their original content.</p>
<p>From artists to educators, singers to dancers, comedians to bodybuilders, the TikTok creator fund allows the brightest TikTokers to earn money through their creative content. It is a type of incentive for the creators and a way for TikTok to express their gratitude to the creator community for their creativity and ingenuity. The goal of the fund is to support the brightest and best TikTok creators who draw audiences to the platform.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Who-is-Eligible-to-Apply-to-the-Creator-Fund-3"><a href="#Part-2-Who-is-Eligible-to-Apply-to-the-Creator-Fund-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Who is Eligible to Apply to the Creator Fund?"></a>Part 2: Who is Eligible to Apply to the Creator Fund?</h2><p>TikTokers can apply for funding through the creator fund and generate income from their videos. Although there’s no limit on the number of creators who can join, there are certain TikTok creator fund requirements that creators have to meet to be able to access the program.</p>
<p>The initial criteria for applying to the TikTok creator fund are:</p>

However, you can set your focus on the creator fund program and grow your account to match the TikTok Creator Fund requirements!</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Top-5-Highest-Paid-TikTokers-3"><a href="#Part-5-Top-5-Highest-Paid-TikTokers-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Top 5 Highest Paid TikTokers"></a>Part 5: Top 5 Highest Paid TikTokers</h2><p>Before we delve into the richest TikTokers, it is recommended to know what TikTok creator Fund pays to users. So far, TikTok hasn’t officially announced what or how much it pays its creators. The creator fund isn’t a grant or an ad revenue-sharing program. However, influencers who are enrolled in the Creator Fund have reported that TikTok pays them between 2 and 4 cents per 1000 views.</p>
<p>TikTok Creator Fund payout depends on a range of factors in relation to your profile and the content you create. These factors include views count and their authenticity, number of engagement, the region where the views come from, and total followers compared to likes. Performance on this social media platform is dynamic as it changes naturally. Besides, the daily funding amount can differ depending on the number of videos released on that day. So, the specific amount differs from one person to another.</p>
<p>Now that you have an idea of the creator fund payout, you might be wondering about top TikTok creators who have monetized their content. Here’s a list of TikTok’s 5 highest paid TikTokers based on Forbes’ list of the highest-earning stars in 2020:</p>
