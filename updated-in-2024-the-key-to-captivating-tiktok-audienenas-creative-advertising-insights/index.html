There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p>
<p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"
                ></p>
<p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p>
<p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p>
<p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p>
<p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p>

<p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p>

                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"
                ></p>
<p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p>
<p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p>
<p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p>
<p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p>

                      alt="tiktok effects ads"
                ></p>
<p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p>

There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p>
<p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"
                ></p>
<p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p>
<p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p>
<p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p>
<p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p>

Slowly you will find your way out and end up surpassing the branded “marketing experts.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?"></a>Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?</h2><p>We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p>
<p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"
                ></p>
<p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p>
<p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p>
<p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p>
<p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok top view ads"
                ></p>
<p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"
                ></p>
<p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p>
<p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p>
<p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p>
<p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok effects ads"
                ></p>
<p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p>

<h3 id="3-Guess-2"><a href="#3-Guess-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Guess"></a>3. Guess</h3><p><img

Gusher</h3><p>Gusher is a candy business that uses TikTok ads to access a broader audience to taste their candies. The first attempt to create a TikTok ad gained new 5 million views. That motivated them to continue using ads that have propelled their business by skyrocketing their purchasing power. TikTok ads have done miracles for many companies, and Gusher is no exception.</p>
<h3 id="5-Ralph-Lauren-2"><a href="#5-Ralph-Lauren-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Ralph Lauren"></a>5. Ralph Lauren</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-ads-ralph-lauren.jpg"
                      alt="ralph lauren"
                ></p>
<p>This was a TikTok ad created to market the clothing business of Ralph Lauren. Did it also use hashtags? Yes, but there was something extra. The company used a social media influencer, Diana Silvers, an actress. Usually, everyone would always want to listen to what celebrities are saying.</p>
<p>The fact that Diana was an actress made the company get recognized. Clients were allowed to make direct purchases just by using a few clicks—the number of customers received that month was tremendous. Increased sales and handling many customers was the talk of the day. It allowed users to access the company directly led to the company using email marketing techniques because of the emails saved during the online purchasing process.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Run-Ads-on-TikTok-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Run-Ads-on-TikTok-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Run Ads on TikTok?"></a>Part 4: How to Run Ads on TikTok?</h2><p>Creating and running adverts on TikTok should not be difficult. The app has a straightforward way of doing it. Whether you have a small business like a freelancer, you will need to advertise it for direct clients. To use ads, go to the dashboard and select the “Campaign” tab, located at the top. Pick from the available sections from the tab depending on your marketing preferences.

<p>Before you begin advertising, have some cash to purchase the ad for as little as $10 for a successful TikTok campaign. The amount you choose to pay depends on the format and duration of the ad. Presently, only short-duration ads are supported. But of course, we expect the period to increase with time. Use the Newsfeed section to get some captivating images for your ads. Also include some videos from your library, template, brilliant video, or upload a new one.</p>

Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p>
<p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p>

                      alt="tiktok top view ads"
                ></p>
<p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"
                ></p>
<p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p>
<p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p>
<p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p>
<p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tiktok effects ads"
                ></p>
<p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p>

Regular updates generally solve issues on the TikTok app. Some mistakes are more prevalent than others. While others emerge relatively infrequently. Although, the more familiar the issue, the more readily it may be rectified. However, for unusual TikTok issues, you need to become more technical or obtain assistance from official sources like customer support. TikTok faults might come from both your side and from TikTok. Locally, your settings might mix up with the app resulting in TikTok issues. Other applications in your phone might potentially interact with TikTok resulting in multiple TikTok failures.</p>

Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection.

<ul>
<li><p>Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network &gt; Open ‘Advanced Options’</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone’s screen.</p>

<p>Part 2. Types of TikTok Bugs Leads to TikTok Not Working</p>
<p>On TikTok’s side, the TikTok issues might be caused by glitches or flaws in the software. There may also be an issue with TikTok’s server resulting in TikTok problems. Regular updates generally solve issues on the TikTok app. Some mistakes are more prevalent than others. While others emerge relatively infrequently. Although, the more familiar the issue, the more readily it may be rectified. However, for unusual TikTok issues, you need to become more technical or obtain assistance from official sources like customer support. TikTok faults might come from both your side and from TikTok. Locally, your settings might mix up with the app resulting in TikTok issues. Other applications in your phone might potentially interact with TikTok resulting in multiple TikTok failures.</p>
<p>You can correct common mistakes easily, and we will show you how. Here is a list of recurrent TikTok faults that you discover every day:</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok is not connecting to the internet.</li>
<li>TikTok is not loading videos.</li>
