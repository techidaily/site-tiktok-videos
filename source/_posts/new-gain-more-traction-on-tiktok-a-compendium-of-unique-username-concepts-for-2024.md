Celebrities like Kevin Hart or Selena Gomez use Triller to record and edit their social media videos because the app makes this process simple. You have to record the footage, and the auto-editing algorithm will do the rest for you. Triller's video editing tools enable you to trim or cut videos, apply more than 50 filters, or even draw over the videos to express your creativity.

If you would like to collaborate with your friends, this app is a great choice, since it offers powerful collab video features. However, Triller is not a networking platform, as it is only a video editing app that doesn't have a community aspect. The app's file-sharing options, on the other hand, enable you to post videos you created to your social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter or save them to the camera roll.
