* If comments still aren’t functioning after a restart, users can try logging out and back in.
* As a final option, you may remove the software totally and re-download it for a reinstall.

### 4\. Clear TikTok App Cache

If your TikTok app is not operating, it's probably an issue with damaged cache data. If you notice, your TikTok app plays certain videos offline when you start it. It's not magic. The cache memory saves certain data temporarily to let the software operate quicker and function effectively. If your TikTok is acting improperly, deleting the cached data may help solve it. Follow the instructions below to do so.

* Launch the Settings app from your app menu, then click on the Apps & Notifications.

* From there, click on the option to see all applications. Usually "App details", "Manage Applications", or "See all apps".

![Storage and Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-4.jpg)

* Finally, press Clear cache to delete the stored data. Now touch the back button once and tap on the Force stop button to quit the TikTok app. After that, re-launch the TikTok app to see whether it rectifies the issue or try another method below.

### 5\. Reset the Network

TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges. Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:

* Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network > Open ‘Advanced Options’

* Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone's screen.

* Then click on reset to default. After performing these instructions leave the settings, then go to your home screen and switch on the mobile data. Then play the video to see whether the fault is fixed.

### 6\. Restart the Devices

If TikTok works on another device or browser from the list above, your device seems to be the issue. If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users. The first thing to do in the case of an application problem on your iPhone device is to switch off then on again. To achieve this, these are the steps to follow:

**For iOS:**

* To begin, touch and hold the Power button until you receive the “Slide to Power Off” option on your screen. Then move the slider to the right until the screen on your iPhone or iPad becomes dark.

* Wait at least 10 seconds after shutting off your iPhone before hitting and holding the Power button until the Apple logo shows on the screen.

![Hold the Power Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-7.jpg)

## Part 4: Conclusion

Sometimes all that TikTok needs is an update. Someone else has undoubtedly run across whatever difficulty you are having earlier and the developer may have published an update that fixes the problem already. If none of the alternatives above work, remove your **TikTok app** according to your device. Go to the App Store or Google Play Store. Search for the **TikTok** **application** and install it. If you are on an Android smartphone, go to the Play Store, search for TikTok, and check if there is an update available. For an iOS device, visit the App Store, press on your profile symbol, then scroll down to check if there's an update. Summing up, these are the few reliable ways to fix your **TikTok bugs** handily.
