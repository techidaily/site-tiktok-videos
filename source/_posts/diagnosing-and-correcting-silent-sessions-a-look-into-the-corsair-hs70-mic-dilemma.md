## Fix 1 – Allow access to your microphone on your PC

 If your Corsair HS35 is not activated in the Window settings, your PC will lack the access to your microphone and so the mic just won’t start to work at all. Follow these steps to allow access to your microphone:

1. Press the**Windows + I** keys to open Windows settings, then select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/setting-Privacy.jpg)
2. Select**Microphone** on the left panel, then click the**Change** button to see if the toggle is**On** in the pop-up menu. If it isn’t, change the toggle to On.

## Fix 5 – Use a USB audio card

 If your computer’s sound card is defective or if your laptop/desktop system has a faulty 3.5mm audio port, the Corsair HS35 mic may not be able to work properly. If that is the case, you might think about using a USB Audio Card, which is an external sound device that can **bypass problems in your built-in sound card and regain the audio function for you** .
