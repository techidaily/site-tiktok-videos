#### 9. [Payphone](https://vm.tiktok.com/wq2wbB/)

The song called Payphone is sung directly from the heart. After listening to it, you feel relaxed and happy. The performers all just look so natural. The famous pop-rock band of America Maroon 5 sung this on 16th April 2012\. It also features Wiz Khalifa, an American rapper. Here, this kid is showing dance moves on the song. Well, he has given some funny bloopers also. That's looking good btw!

#### 10. [Sicko Mode](https://vm.tiktok.com/wq2yPd/)

American rapper Travis Scott also sang Sicko Mode. It got so much love from fans that even the TikTok got significantly stuffed with this hit album. We found this TikTok song where Travis Scott himself is singing on stage and just rocking. The stage performance looked magnificent, where everyone got the adrenaline rush to sing along.
