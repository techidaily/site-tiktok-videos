## Part 4: FAQs about downloading TikTok video

**1\. Does TikTok notify someone if you download a video?**

When someone saves your video, TikTok does not notify you. When you save a video, TikTok labels it as a Share in the user's TikTok Analytics. Moreover, TikTok always leaves a watermark on the downloaded video that restrict someone from using your video and label it as their original content. However, if they have third-party apps to remove the watermark, then it can become a problem for you.

**2\. Is it ethical to download a TikTok video?**

According to TikTok's Community Guidelines, individuals are not permitted to upload, transmit, or email any content that infringes on the copyrights, trademarks, or proprietary rights. So, it is not ethical to download the content of other people from TikTok.
