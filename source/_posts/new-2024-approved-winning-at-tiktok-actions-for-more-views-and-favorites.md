Adding Tags sounds simple. However, it gives unprecedented results for your TikTok account and posted videos. What you need to do is, at the end of the post (or in the middle also), you need to put some valuable hashtags (the symbol "# followed by a short text without space"), which tells about your video genre. So, whenever any user clicks on the particular hashtags, those users will directly be able to see your video content, media file, or will get directed to your content area. Thus, giving your post a boost. Hence this is how to get views on TikTok.

#### Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day

You must be aware of the idea of activeness. Whoever remains active wins the race. The fact behind is, if you actively engage in posting the content over your TikTok account, then the users will feel the sense of connection, and the chain reaction will increase the size of followers day by day.

Further, be consistent in posting at least one post per day. It will reflect your keen interest in the TikTok profile.

#### Tip 3: ‘For You’ page

Another valuable trick is to involve/include the front page, 'For You' page for the users. It will direct and suggest the users' relevant link, content, or video of their interests according to their search history. So, when any user lands on your page, they will get the content of interest, enhancing their chances of revisiting your profile. Also, you will get an idea of what is the most liked video on TikTok.

#### Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends

Preparing a video or media for the TikTok profile is a good idea, but posting some exciting content along with your friend is a beautiful idea. That will double the chance of getting the more viewer list of your TikTok account. Even you will see that taking the collaboration or help of your friends to create the content will make the video more interactive and exciting.

#### Tip 5: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments

Your users are the real source for the promotion of your profile in the TikTok world and to know how to get more views and likes on TikTok. So better be involved with them as much as possible. Actively write comments, so whenever a user visits your profile, they see that you write comments regularly, and most probably revert to your account or profile.

Even you can represent your profile in such a way that it will look not only attractive but also reflect professionalism to the users.

#### Tip 7: Selecting the most appropriate song
