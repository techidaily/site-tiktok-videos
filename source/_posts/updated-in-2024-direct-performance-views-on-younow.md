* Users these days are restricted to use banned words to their live videos. The list includes BFF, follow, fan, duet, donation and drama queen, etc. It is better to use some alternating words to make your video valuable online.
* In case if you are not able to see the Live Button on the screen; the chances are that your device is doing some audio recording because the Live option disappears during such recordings. There is no need to go to any song rather you have to hit the Plus+ button available on the bottom of the screen, and soon a video button will appear on the screen, besides this button; you will also find the option to Go Live.
* Some rumors say that the Tik Tok app allows only 1k fans to go live at an instant; however, reports say that this count keeps on varying in different countries.

**Conclusion:**

Probably, now you have collected all the essential information about the Go Live feature of the TikTok app. This is another interesting thing to do online but make sure you have an updated version of the app to start creating your own live streams using TikTok. Prefer to use some interesting captions for your live videos so that they can capture more attention online.

 There is a prominent plus sign button in the middle of the screen. You can press and hold that button just like on snapchat for as long as your desire to make your video. There is also a handsfree feature available on the right side of the screen in the shape of a clock. The timer will start and your video will automatically start recording.

 Once you are done with that, there is a “pick soundtrack” option that comes on the top of your screen from which you can pick the song of your liking from the wide variety of songs available in the Tik Tok music album. You can even trim the soundtrack by clicking on the scissor icon and trim it according to your preference. You can even pick a song before recording and mimic that song. There are also video speed options which can help you adjust the speed of your video and soundtrack making it slower or faster

 After that, you can apply filters and even video effect. There is a vast range available which will make your video more creative and fun.

 When you’re completely done with the video, you can select a cover or thumbnail for your video and you are all ready to upload.

 Click next and showcase your fantastic work, add hashtags and catchy captions and gain more likes!
