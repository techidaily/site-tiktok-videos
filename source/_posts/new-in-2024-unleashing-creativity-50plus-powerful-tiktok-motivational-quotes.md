The app is majorly focused on creating short video-based content and sharing it with others on the platform. Users can directly record their videos, add media content (like soundtracks), apply filters, and do so much more.

## Part 2: How to Use Cool TikTok Photo Editing Hacks?

Most of the TikTok users only take the assistance of the app to edit their videos on the go. Though, a **TikTok picture edit trend** is lately going viral on the social media platform.

The best part is that the popular TikTok photo edit hack is super-easy to implement and can drastically change the overall visual appeal of your pictures. The hack would make your photos look more vibrant and colorful while still maintaining their authenticity. Here’s how you can also implement this TikTok iPhone photo editing hack without any hassle:

1. At first, you can just go to the Photos app, open any picture, and click on the “Edit” button from the top.
2. Once the editing interface of the photo is opened, you can go to its Exposure field and set it to its maximum value, which is 100 (please note that this is an optional step).
3. Great! Now, go to the “Highlights” field and set its value to negative 35.
4. Afterward, change the “Shadow” effect to a negative 28 value and keep the “Contrast” value to minus 30.

1. Now, you can set the “Brightness” value to minus 5 and the “Back Point” value to exact 10.
2. You are almost there. You can now put the “Saturation” value to 10 and keep its “Vibrance” level to 8.
3. Furthermore, go to the “Warmth” field and keep it to 10 while its “Tint” value has to be set to 39.
4. Besides that, you also have to set its “Sharpness” count to 14 and the “Vignette” value to 23.

In case you have set the Exposure field to 100 (the optional step), then you need to set the Brilliance and Exposure value to 0 in the end. That’s it! After following this viral TikTok photo editing hack, you can get that perfect sun-kissed picture.

## Part 3: Viral TikTok Photo/Video Trends You Should Know

While this TikTok photo editing hack has been quite popular, the social media platform has given rise to tons of other trends as well. Here are some of these popular TikTok video/photo editing trends that you can explore.

#### 1\. Runaway by Aurora Trend

This is one of the most aesthetically pleasing trends that has been all over TikTok in 2021\. In this, the popular song Runaway by Aurora is played in the background and the inbuilt TikTok filter is used. It will freeze the frame while recording the video and would automatically change the background to make it look appealing.

#### 2\. Fake Window Trend

The Fake Window trend has been on TikTok for a while now and would only need a projector. As the name suggests, you just have to use a projector to display all kinds of images on a wall or a curtain (making it look like a window). Go ahead and unleash your creative ideas for some stunning video projections and post them on TikTok.

#### 3\. Questions I Get Asked… Trend

TikTok keeps hosting tons of popular trends and this one is no such exception. In this, people simply post videos in which they share some peculiar questions that they get asked a lot. The trend became extremely popular, and you would find the experience of other TikTok users quite funny.

#### 4\. Outfit Challenge

Lastly, this is the most popular ongoing trend on TikTok that you can also explore. In this, people simply pose with some of their best outfits with a trendy song playing in the background. Therefore, if you are into fashion, then this would be one of the best TikTok trends to explore.

## Part 4: Edit Your TikTok Videos with Filmora
