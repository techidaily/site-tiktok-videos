GIF means "Graphics Interchange Format" For TikTok and other social media platforms and is referred to as a short animated picture without any sound and is typically used as memes to portray a reaction or an emotion. TikTok allows you to share videos with other users outside of the application as GIFs instead of a video clip, and most times, these GIFs can be helpful in memes.
