## Part 1: What is TikTok Creator Fund?

TikTok’s Creator Fund program is a $200 million cash fund, growing to $1billion over the next 3 years, to reward TikTokers for creating authentic, entertaining, and engaging video content. Launched in 2020, the TikTok creator fund is the opportunity of a lifetime for determined video creators to earn per view on their original content.

From artists to educators, singers to dancers, comedians to bodybuilders, the TikTok creator fund allows the brightest TikTokers to earn money through their creative content. It is a type of incentive for the creators and a way for TikTok to express their gratitude to the creator community for their creativity and ingenuity. The goal of the fund is to support the brightest and best TikTok creators who draw audiences to the platform.

## Part 2: Who is Eligible to Apply to the Creator Fund?

TikTokers can apply for funding through the creator fund and generate income from their videos. Although there’s no limit on the number of creators who can join, there are certain TikTok creator fund requirements that creators have to meet to be able to access the program.

The initial criteria for applying to the TikTok creator fund are:

* Must be at least 18 years of age
* Should have at least 10, 000 followers

In other words, the creator fund is for content creators who have already proven their ability to make popular content. If you do not meet the above requirements, you won’t be able to access the creator fund or the income it provides. So, unless you have a moderate level of popularity on TikTok, you won’t be able to qualify to receive money from the creator fund. However, you can set your focus on the creator fund program and grow your account to match the TikTok Creator Fund requirements!

## Authenticity Matters: Ensuring Your TikToks Are Legally Uploaded

So, you have successfully created an awesome TikTok video with the perfect dance moves and accurate lip-sync. But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!

The reason?

Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!

This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.

So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?

To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.

And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.

## **Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?**

To avoid getting banned!

You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.

The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.

If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.

To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.

But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?

Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

## **Conclusion**

While making TikTok videos is quite a fun activity, we have to follow the rules, especially those revolving around using copyrighted material. According to TikTok’s policies, if a video has copyrighted sound, it will be muted, and if the video itself is copyrighted, like a clip from a movie or song, it will be taken down.

However, if you continue posting copyrighted content even after receiving copyright infringement notices from TikTok, it can result in your getting shut down for good!

Therefore, it’s good to know how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading through the steps explained in the article.

So, run a copyright check, and play it safe!

## **Conclusion**

While making TikTok videos is quite a fun activity, we have to follow the rules, especially those revolving around using copyrighted material. According to TikTok’s policies, if a video has copyrighted sound, it will be muted, and if the video itself is copyrighted, like a clip from a movie or song, it will be taken down.

However, if you continue posting copyrighted content even after receiving copyright infringement notices from TikTok, it can result in your getting shut down for good!

Therefore, it’s good to know how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading through the steps explained in the article.

So, run a copyright check, and play it safe!
