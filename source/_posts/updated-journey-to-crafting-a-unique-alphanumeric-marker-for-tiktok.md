Changing the alpha opacity of the TikTok anime filter

Alpha opacity determines the transparency of the video, and it has a range of 0 to 100\. Usually, a lower value means that your video is too transparent. Double click on the filter to alter its transparency, then confirm from the preview window. Chang it until you find a better video opacity.

**5\. How to use your favorite filters?**

In the effects menu, right-click on the filter effect and select "**Add to Favorite**" from the menu that appears. Once you finish, go to your favorite section, where you will quickly locate it.
