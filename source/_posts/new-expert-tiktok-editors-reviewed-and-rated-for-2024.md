 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Becoming an instant online celebrity with millions of followers has never been easier. This trend started on [YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and has spread to other social media like [TikTok](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.

Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.

## How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools

In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.

To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.

Moreover, the app lets you [control the video’s playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to [apply stickers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add [text layers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and [adjust the volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.

The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.

This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to [add the description of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.

## Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos

The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks. That is why a growing number of TikTok’s users opt for third-party apps that are equipped with the tools they can use to [improve the quality of the content](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) they share on this social network.

Becoming an instant online celebrity with millions of followers has never been easier. This trend started on [YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and has spread to other social media like [TikTok](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.

Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.

## How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools

In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.

To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page.

Moreover, the app lets you [control the video’s playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to [apply stickers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add [text layers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and [adjust the volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.

The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.

* [Part 2: Still Want to Delete TikTok Accounts? Think Twice!](#part2)
* [Part 3: Other Options to Deactivate TikTok Accounts](#part3)

## How to Delete an Account?

Only a short while ago users of the TikTok platform had to contact the customer support in order to delete their accounts. However, the recent introduction of the **'Thinking about removing your account'** option has made this task much quicker. Here's how you can delete a TikTok account permanently in just a few easy steps.

#### Step 1

After you've launched the app, click on the **Profile Information** icon in the lower right corner of the app's window. Tap on the **Settings option** and then select the **Privacy and Settings feature** from the menu that pops up on the screen. Choose the **Manage my Account** option from the Settings menu, then locate the **Phone Number feature** and tap on it to insert your phone number. The app will send a **one-time password (OTP)** to your phone, so you just have to enter the **verification code** into the appropriate box, and your phone will be connected to your TikTok account.

Making short music videos you can share with millions of people might help you jump start your career in the music industry. At the moment TikTok is one of the best video sharing platforms for aspiring music video producers because it has more than 500 million active monthly users.

While joining the TikTok's community and creating your own account is a simple process, deleting an account is a bit more complicated. The lack of privacy settings is often the reason why the app's users are choosing to delete their accounts permanently. If you'd like to **deactivate your TikTok account**, you come to the right place, because in this article, we're going to take you through all the steps of canceling a TikTok account.

## How to Delete an Account?

Only a short while ago users of the TikTok platform had to contact the customer support in order to delete their accounts. However, the recent introduction of the **'Thinking about removing your account'** option has made this task much quicker. Here's how you can delete a TikTok account permanently in just a few easy steps.

#### Step 1

You must first **add a phone number** to a TikTok account before you can proceed to delete it. After you've launched the app, click on the **Profile Information** icon in the lower right corner of the app's window. Tap on the **Settings option** and then select the **Privacy and Settings feature** from the menu that pops up on the screen. Choose the **Manage my Account** option from the Settings menu, then locate the **Phone Number feature** and tap on it to insert your phone number. The app will send a **one-time password (OTP)** to your phone, so you just have to enter the **verification code** into the appropriate box, and your phone will be connected to your TikTok account.

#### Step 2

Afterward, you should once again tap on the **Profile Information** icon in the lower right corner.

Locate the **Thinking about removing your account** feature, then tap on it and the app will send an OTP message to your phone automatically.

#### Step 3

Insert the **verification code** you received in the OTP message into the appropriate box and hit the **Continue button** to complete the process of deleting your TikTok account.

Keep in mind that your account cannot be recovered once it is deleted and that all information that wasn't saved on it such as chat messages is going to remain visible to other users of the TikTok platform after you deactivate your account.

## Think Twice Before Deleting Your Account

If you don't want to lose all the videos you shared on TikTok you should download them from your profile to your phone because all the data that was stored on your account is going to be deleted. What's more, you will not receive a refund for any in-app purchases you made while you were using TikTok. If you would only like to go on a social media hiatus for a while, the app offers some advanced options that will enable you to keep your account while remaining completely invisible on the platform. Here are some of the solutions you might want to consider before deciding to delete your TikTok account forever.

## 3 Alternatives to Deleting a TikTok Account

The platform offers several advanced options to its users that enable them to be hidden from the public eye. That's why you don't have to deactivate your TikTok account if you don't want your music videos to be accessible to other users of the platform. Here are a few alternative options you have at your disposal.

#### Set Privacy Settings to Private

The TikTok app can be used in **Private mode,** even though all accounts on the platform are **Public** when you first create them. All new followers will have to send you a friend request in order to view your videos once you switch to private mode, which enables you to control who can see the content you share on your account. This option can be activated by heading over to the **Settings menu** and choosing the **Privacy and Safety feature.** Afterward, you just have to toggle the **Private Account option** **on**, and after a short while, only your followers will be able to see the content you post on TikTok.

#### Prevent Other Users From Finding You

The '**Allow others to find me'** option lets you control who can see your profile because if you enable it, your account won't appear in the friend suggestions other users receive from the platform. You can find this option in the **Privacy and Safety menu**, so you can just switch it off if it's enabled by default. You can switch it back on whenever you want if at any point you decide that you want to be featured in follower suggestions.

#### Control Who Can Send You Messages and Post Comments on Your Videos

Limiting the number of people who can get in touch with you through TikTok is another way to increase your safety on this video sharing platform. **Who can send me messages,** and **Who can send me comments** options are available in the **Privacy and Safety** menu, so you can easily set both of these options to **Just Friends** if you'd like to avoid receiving messages from TikTok users you don't know.

### Conclusion

The recent updates of the app and the introduction of the Thinking about removing your account option made deleting a TikTok account a quick process. However, this action is permanent and once you deactivate your account, you won't be able to use it again. That's why you need to think about this decision through, especially because the app offers a number of ways to increase your privacy.
