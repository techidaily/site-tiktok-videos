#### Step 2: Download your favorite TikTok video

Go to TikTok, search your favorite song, and download any particular video on it. It’s pretty simple to download from there. If you're on a laptop, you can right-click the video. Else, you can simply long-press the video on a smartphone and hit **Save Video**.

Go to **Media**\> +**Drop** icon button to import the **TikTok song** video.
