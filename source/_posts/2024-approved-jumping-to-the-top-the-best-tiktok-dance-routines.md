## Part 1: Why are TikTok Dances Popular around the World?

By far, the highly famous or popular TikTok dances with 29.7 million-plus users attempting the quick-paced choreography are the "renegade", as mentioned earlier. However, it's perhaps one of the primary viral dances to break out of the app’s confines itself and influence multiple other TikTokers to strive to be trending all over.

You need to understand the anatomy of this TikTok 2022 dance going famous along with its strategies to know how a TikTok dance can become popular around the globe.

The original dance was by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019 and promptly fueled up with middle and high school students. Given the song "Lottery" by K Camp, Harmon's dance has been observed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.

Here's a girl named Kara Leigh Cannella, who is a senior dance major at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia

She was scrolling through TikTok one day this fall when she came across a sound that grabbed her attention. It was called HOOPLA, a 15-second clip by the user known as @kyleyoumadethat, and it promptly made her wish to dance.

She began by improvising, as she often does while choreographing for TikTok. Between famous moves like the Woah and the Wave, she mimed releasing a basketball into the air and dribbling it between her legs, reflecting sound themes (which samples the song "Basketball" 2002 Lil Bow Wow ).

"Then I cleaned up the moves," she says, "because I was like, 'I don't want to make this too hard.' "

Cannella, 22, had struck an excellent balance for TikTok dance virality though she was not aware of it yet: something rhythmically satisfying and eye-catching but still accessible, not beyond the real amateur dancers. She showed the dance in her bathroom and posted it with a call to "try it and tag me."

To her surprise, by the following day, the video received 10,000 likes, and soon the dance was all around the TikTok platform, also tried by the app's most-followed user, a 16-year-old dancer, Charli D'Amelio. She posted it for her then-95 million followers.

So, this was the overall pick behind popular TikTok dances 2022, which you can observe that there's no such rocket science in letting dance become highly trending.

Dance has always found a social media audience, but TikTok, more so than other platforms, has given a boom to its own highly recognizable, simply reproducible style.

Being inspired from a lexicon of hip-hop–inspired moves—like the Dougie, Throw It Back, and the Dice Roll, to name just a few—the micro TikTok dance songs 2022 are generally front-facing most animated from the hips up.

They specifically cater to the smartphone screen vertical frame. Governed by time limits between 15 to 60 seconds, they also tend to preserve in a single place; you can do them anywhere pretty much.

While many professional dancers display their hard-earned TikTok skills, the app, globally released in 2018, has become recognized as a space where everyone is for dance.

"It's not about having the perfect dance body; it doesn't matter if you're a pro," says Alessandro Bogliari, the Influencer Marketing Factory's CEO, a company that ramps within SMM campaigns. "It's about re-creating and having certain funny moves."

1. **Why Username Matters?**

Starting from a Google mail account to a social media account, every entry has a username and a password. Usually, most of us have our names as usernames but in different ways. In contrast, some have their birthday date numerals, favorite personality names, foreign language collage, or their pet names as their username. When it comes to a brand marketing or follow-up page, a good username becomes a vital one. A small, creative, rocking, but a unique username grabs attention rather than long run of alphabets or numbers in serious.

You must choose a username that is not too complex to remember and simple to communicate and pass on to closed ones. While some think that username is just a space in the account creation, the real fact is that it is the online persona and the representation of an individual in digital means.

1. **How to Change Username on TikTok: a Step-by-Step Guide**

Changing username for your Tiktok account isn’t difficult, but you must keep in mind that the username gets attached in every post or video that you post from your account. In other words, the username becomes the brand name for your TikTok videos.

Hence, be cautious that your username isn’t of a standard type because Tiktok allows you to change it once in 30 days only. You would not be able to change it in between. Another factor why a username change is difficult in Tiktok is because Tiktok is very mindful of online safety. A separate team at Tiktok ensures that the account is real and not a fraud or scam.

Now, there are some rules that a Tiktok user must maintain before proceeding to username creation. Here is the list:

* Avoid using your mail address in place of the username as both are completely for different purpose.
* You should carefully avoid using personal details such as full name, address, or phone number can be avoided as username. Country Names are preferable but don’t go off grainy.
* Never try a username that could get traced to find your account password.
* Avoid usage of inappropriate usernames.
* Avoiding generic names, rather something weird or off the book that can stay at the back of your audience’s head.
* You can let the username be related to your content or intentions.
* If your account is business-based, make an identity based on the brand.

Have you decided on a username for your Tiktok account, and are ready to change it? Well, then here is a step-by-step guide on **how to change your Tiktok username.**

**Step 1**: In your smartphone, open the TikTok application. Log on to your account if not logged in.

**Step 5**: Enter the new username by deleting the old one.

**Step 6**: Hit the “Save” button.

It just takes a couple of minutes to change your Tiktok username.

Do note that if the name isn’t registered before in the database, you can begin, but if the username is already available, you will get notified and you would have to try out another.

1. **Get Inspired by Creative and Cool Usernames**

So, you now know **how to change the Tiktok username**, and do you have any idea on how to proceed further. There are different types of tiktokers, and their interest is what makes the difference. Here are some fresh and exciting username suggestions from which you can choose and build your own based on it.

If you are a motivational tiktoker, try Bean secrets, Elite, cubicle force, Haughty leaders, and Open book. For professional tiktoker, it is the bridge connect, business preachers, capitalist crew, innovation geeks, and passionate entrepreneurs.

Are you an art or music lover? Dream makers, Icon lover, viola, craft lady, and lasting beauty are some username ideas for you. Especially for makeup tiktokers, Queen hood, butterfly on rose, glowing gold, doll diamond, and bubbles are unbeatable.

As for rocking game tiktokers, we have electric players, which are aggressively new, extreme, ever since never, flame, gaming changing, life racer, and no limits on hand.

If you are tired of thinking one, then online username generators like Jimpix and LastPass can lend you a hand.

1. **Conclusion**

Username can either build your account else shatter it too. In the increasing competition among Tiktokers, the username is the first-sight impressions that bring your account popularity and make them a shining star in the sky of tokers.

Think of a new username for your account and wait for your account to get noticed by millions of audiences around the world.
