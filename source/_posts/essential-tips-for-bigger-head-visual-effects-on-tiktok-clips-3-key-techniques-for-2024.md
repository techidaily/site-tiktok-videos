## Part 3: Why You Shouldn't Remove the Watermark from TikTok Videos?

People have divided opinions when it comes to keeping the watermark logo or getting rid of it entirely. Understandably, the TikTok emblem can be bothersome to specific users because it seems an "extra" item on the screen rather than a part of the content.

## Part 3: Why You Shouldn't Remove the Watermark from TikTok Videos?

People have divided opinions when it comes to keeping the watermark logo or getting rid of it entirely. Understandably, the TikTok emblem can be bothersome to specific users because it seems an "extra" item on the screen rather than a part of the content.

Yet, this does not imply that we support or urge its removal. If you're seeking to promote your content across many channels, you must retain the watermark since it allows the creator of the content to be correctly recognized.

## Part 4: FAQs About Downloading TikTok Video

**1\. Why Can't I Download Some TikTok Videos?**

There could be a few reasons for you not being able to download some TikTok videos. One of the foremost is that the video creator has disabled video downloads. Other causes include insufficient memory, account problems, internet connectivity issues, and an old version of TikTok on your smartphone.

**2\. How Many Videos Can I Download from TikTok?**

In most cases, there is no restriction to how many videos you can download on TikTok. You are free to download an unlimited number of TikTok videos.

**3\. How to Get the TikTok Video Link on iPhone and Android?**

First, you need to head over to your profile section and click on the three-dot option present in the top right corner. Tap on Manage Account and then select Switch to My Pro Account. Now you will see two options: Creator and Business. Use the Business option to choose one category and press on Next to advance. Now you will see a link in your profile bio.
