What brands search for are different influencers either according to the niche or growth of a particular Tik Tok account. Nowadays, influencers have to contact brands for promotions or stuff like that. So, if you have more count on followers and engagement as an influencer, you would be going to get the right amount on those sponsorships.

The most important aspect is to calculate the engagement rate. It is because it's a highly considerable factor brand may look. However, there is no official method to calculate the engagement rate. Most of the published ones are inaccurate. They won't tell you the correct specs about the percentage of people opening the app once a day. For accuracy concerns, we've devised a formula to calculate individual Tik Tok account engagement. The formula states as \[No. of hearts + No. of comments\]/ No. of followers\] × 100.
