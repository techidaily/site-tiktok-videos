Every rising pop star needs music videos, but using professional video editing software may be too time-consuming if you want to quickly create a clone video you can share with your fans on TikTok.

Multiplying yourself in a video is a cool way of making sure that your video is going to get the kind of attention it deserves. The process of [cloning yourself in a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a simple one, but there are certain rules you have to follow while recording the footage that will help you avoid overlapping the figures you're cloning. Here's how you can make your first **clone yourself video on TikTok**.

![Clone Yourself on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clone-yourself-on-tiktok.jpg)

## Selecting the Song for your Clone Video

Before you start shooting the video you first need to select the song on [TikTok](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id835599320?mt=8)you're going to use in the video. Once you've found the perfect track simply record it and save it as a video to your camera roll. You can then import the video clip that contains the song into the [Video Star](http://videostarapp.com/) app.

Here are [10 Popular TikTok Songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you.

## Using the Video Star App to Clone Yourself

#### 1\. Download Video Star App

Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you'll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don't have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone's native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.

#### 2\. Edit Multiple Video Clips

After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone's native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn't overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.

#### 3\. Level up Your Videos with Video Star

Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you'll be recording like TikTok does on fast.

Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone's location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.

To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you're not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.

When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn't come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video's shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.

Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don't want to use.

The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you've edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.

### Conclusion

Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time. The Video Star app lets you create as many clones of yourself as you want, so you just have to make sure that your video clips can be easily combined to feature two or more of your clones and have fun exploring the effects that can make your videos look even cooler. If you want to be a success on the TikTok platform, learning how to make clone videos is one of the best ways to do it, so choose your favorite songs and start producing clone yourself videos.

## Engineering a Touching TikTok Conclusion

If you're just getting started on TikTok, you might be wondering why people bother with TikTok outros. After all, they're just a few seconds of a clip at the end of your videos. Why not just let the video end and move on?

Well, TikTok outros are actually a really important part of the platform. They're a great way to promote your other social media platforms, give your viewers a call to action, or just show off your personality.

![create outros for tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-outros-for-tiktok.png)

In this article, we'll show you how to **create an outro for TikTok** that is sure to leave an ever-lasting impression on those watching your content. In the end, we'll recommend the best video editors that you can use to make your videos engaging by creating the perfect outros every time.

## Part 1\. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video

The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.

An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.

Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it's important to make it count!

![outros template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png)

### Elements of an Outro

Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:

* **Subscription:** Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it's released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.
* **The Next Video to Watch:** If you have other episodes/parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.
* **Your Social Media Channels:** Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.
* **Use Stunning Visuals:** Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.

### How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?

If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.

To **create a good outro for your TikTok**, follow the below tips:

* Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.
* Keep your outro short and sweet because you don't want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.
* Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.
* Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and/or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.
* Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.
* Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.

## Part 2\. An Excellent Video Editor for Your TikTok Adventure

While popular culture and many influencers might have you believe that TikTok is all about kids lip-syncing to pop songs, there's so much more to this social media platform. Recently, it has become a powerful marketing tool for small to mid-sized businesses.

The best way to use TikTok's platform for marketing is to create engaging outros for your videos. For this, you'll need video editing software like Filmora and a little creative mind. With this program, you can easily add text, music, and effects to your TikTok clips to make them truly stand out.

Below are some features of Filmora software:

* Built-in music library.
* Easy to use even for novice users.
* Numerous effects and a color tuning tool.
* Noise removal and an audio equalizer.
* 4k video editing support
