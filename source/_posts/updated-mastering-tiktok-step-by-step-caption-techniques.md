TikTok users like you flock to the app due to its entertainment value, global reach, and ease of use. When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.

The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.

1. You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.

2. Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.

3. Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.

4. After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.

5. Once the video is uploaded, you will be asked to put in a caption. We advise you to keep the caption quirky and fun. Another quick tip is that you should use hashtags that are trending at the moment as that will increase the visual appearance of your video more.

6. Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.
