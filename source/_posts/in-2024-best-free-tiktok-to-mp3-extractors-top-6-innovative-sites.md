Unlike [duets](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that play videos together, stitched videos play in the sequence they were stitched. Videos containing open-ended questions have gained in popularity with the advent of the stitch.

Whenever you Stitch a clip-on TikTok, you are essentially inserting your video after yet another video that has already been submitted. People frequently utilize this to remark on or reply to other videos. And, when done well, it can add a lot more context to your movies.

The one limitation of the Stitch tool is that you may only publish **up to five seconds** from some other video. So, if you're focusing on a Stitch, you must select the five seconds which are most critical to highlight your message.
