1. That you check your internet connection. A stable internet connection will give you the best user experience.
2. If the website is still is not loading then go to the browser’s settings and clear out related caches and cookies.

If you are facing some other kind of problem then you can always directly contact the support team at TikTok.

1. Go to your profile by clicking on **Me**.![titok me screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/TikTok-Me-Screen-.png)
