## Scripting the Final Push for Your TikTok Series

If you're just getting started on TikTok, you might be wondering why people bother with TikTok outros. After all, they're just a few seconds of a clip at the end of your videos. Why not just let the video end and move on?

Well, TikTok outros are actually a really important part of the platform. They're a great way to promote your other social media platforms, give your viewers a call to action, or just show off your personality.

![create outros for tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-outros-for-tiktok.png)

In this article, we'll show you how to **create an outro for TikTok** that is sure to leave an ever-lasting impression on those watching your content. In the end, we'll recommend the best video editors that you can use to make your videos engaging by creating the perfect outros every time.

## Part 1\. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video

The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.

An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.

Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it's important to make it count!

![outros template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png)

### Elements of an Outro

Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:

* **Subscription:** Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it's released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.
* **The Next Video to Watch:** If you have other episodes/parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.
* **Your Social Media Channels:** Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.
* **Use Stunning Visuals:** Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.

### How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?

If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.

To **create a good outro for your TikTok**, follow the below tips:

* Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.
* Keep your outro short and sweet because you don't want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.
* Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.
* Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and/or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.
* Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.
* Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.
