## Part 3: Top 3 TikTok Username Generators

The TikTok username generator is generally for designing fonts. Since TikTok does not allow this facility, it helps users work on unforgettable characters in their nicknames. Using an incredible TikTok username generator can also help you creatively attract more followers.

Here's all you are required to know regarding grabbing the good TikTok usernames!

### 1. [Cool Generator](https://www.coolgenerator.com/tiktok-name-generator)

As the name suggests, it's a pretty cool username generator that you can use by just putting the random idea. However, you also can select among a **boy** or a **girl** from the drop-down menu. Beneath these tabs, you have **an Idea** to describe your thoughts or brand identity in a few simple words or phrases.

For instance, we have entered **the Dance** keyword, and it offers a ton of ideas, including new ones.

### 2. [Spinxo](https://www.spinxo.com/tiktok-names)

![spinxo tiktok name generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spinxo-name-generator.jpg)

Spinxo is another username generator with a variety of name-generating options. It has different tabs called **Name or Nickname**, **What are you like**, **Hobbies**, **Things You Like**, **Important Words**, **Numbers or Letters**, etc.

After entering all these ideas in your mind, tap the **Spin** button and get many **TikTok username** **ideas** again.

### 3. [Business Name Generator](https://businessnamegenerator.com/username-generator/)

Our last pick is quite a simple username generator where you need to enter a keyword or an idea and hit the **Generate** button. However, the best part is that you can quickly check the domain availability on GoDaddy by toggling the option given beneath the tab.

So, that's the USP of this generator!
