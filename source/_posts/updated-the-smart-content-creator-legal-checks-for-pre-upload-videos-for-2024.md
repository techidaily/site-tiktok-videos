## The Smart Content Creator: Legal Checks for Pre-Upload Videos

So, you have successfully created an awesome TikTok video with the perfect dance moves and accurate lip-sync. But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!

The reason?

Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!

This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.

So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?

To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.

And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.

## **Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?**

To avoid getting banned!

You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.

The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.

If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.

To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.

But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?

Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Therefore, if you’re posting a sound other than one from TikTok’s library, you can check if it’s copyrighted or not from your PC.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

You can cut and trim out unnecessary sound sections from the recorded voiceover or apply the fade effects to the voiceover for a smoother transition.

**Step 4: Sync Voiceover to Video**

Now, it’s time to synchronize the recorded voiceover to video to create a compelling video.

The Wondershare Filmora allows up to 100 audio tracks; you can also add some background music to the voiceover.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video content to the video track, drag and drop the soundtrack to the video's right-side position. Keep the voice and video track in the exact video duration if required.

**Here’s how to sync voiceover to video!**

Now, sync the recorded voiceover to Video to create a video. Since Filmora is compatible with 100 plus audio tracks, you can add different background music to the voiceover.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video content to the video track, drag and drop the soundtrack to the Video's right side position. You can keep the Video and audio track in the same video duration.

If you've recorded the voice over on your iPhone or another device already, even via the Wondershare Filmora, and wish to add it to the Video, visit the steps mentioned below:

**1\. Upload the video to Filmora**

After logging in to Filmora’s main editing interface, click "Import" or drag-drop your video and voiceover file to the project library.

Filmora video editing software is compatible with a vast range of formats, so there will be no need to convert the files before import.

Drag and drop the files or video content to the Video Timeline when all the files get imported.
