**Step 2**: Drag and drag the video right into the interface to edit it. Alternatively, you can choose "**Add files**" from the drop-down menu by clicking the **"+"** button. Using the media library, drag and drop the video you wish to slow down onto the timeline once added to the project.

**Note**: The Filmora Video Editor enables you to modify the **_playback speed_** to as little as **TEN** times slower than the actual speed of the video.

After that, you may use various editing tools to create your video one-of-a-kind and spectacular, depending on your requirements.

**Step 5**: It's time to save your modified movie clip to your device. Click the Export button to save the video to your local or share to YouTube or Vimeo directly.
