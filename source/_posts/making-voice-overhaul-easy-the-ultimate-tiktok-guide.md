## Part 1: What is Voice Effect?

Picture filters are widely used on Instagram and Snapchat, and we are all acquainted with them. Such filters enable us to add a subtle color change or any other type of modification to our filters. However, because TikTok is all about audio and video, you may utilize voice filters in your videos.

Speech filters are sound effects that enable us to alter our voices. It's worth noting that users can only use the application to apply speech filters to their recorded voice. When you're not using or uploading any recordings, you won't utilize any voice effects.

Built-in voice effects in TikTok include chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals.

## Part 1: What is Voice Effect?

Picture filters are widely used on Instagram and Snapchat, and we are all acquainted with them. Such filters enable us to add a subtle color change or any other type of modification to our filters. However, because TikTok is all about audio and video, you may utilize voice filters in your videos.

Speech filters are sound effects that enable us to alter our voices. It's worth noting that users can only use the application to apply speech filters to their recorded voice. When you're not using or uploading any recordings, you won't utilize any voice effects.

Built-in voice effects in TikTok include chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals.

## Part 2: How to Record and Add Voice TikTok?

Your video must feature your voice to apply Voice Effects. You can't utilize Voice Effects in films created with built-in themes, including audio, for example.

**Step 1:** To begin recording your clip, launch TikTok and hit the **\+ (plus symbol)** at the base.

**Step 2:** Press the **Record** button, record your video as usual, and tap it again to stop or end the recording. Once you're done recording, tick the **Checkmark.**

**Step 3:** Select **Voice Effects** from the drop-down menu on the upper right.

![record tiktok video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tiktok-video-audio.jpg)

**Step 4:** Tap to hear every one of the effects as the window opens up from the bottom. When you wish to utilize one, pick it and move your finger away from the screen. Tap **None** on the far left when you don't want to employ an voice effect.

**Step 5:** After that, you may add any extra effects to your movie, such as text stickers. When you're finished, tap **Next**. Proceed to choose your Post choices, save the video, or touch **Post** as you would with any other video you've made.

## The Template Trick for Eye-Catching TikTok Creation Mastery

TikTok is the video platform that shook the world during the pandemic. It capitalized on people's shortened attention spans and focused on short-form videos to provide entertainment. Also, it provided people with an easy road to fame and with a solid side hustle.

Are you one of those who aspire to be TikTok's future top-earner? Try making videos using **TikTok video templates**! They'll allow you to churn out high-quality content faster than the competition. In this article, you will learn more about TikTok videos. Furthermore, we'll introduce you to the 5 best places from where you can find great TikTok video templates.

![use templates to create tiktok videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-template.gif)

Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos

TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for "bite-sized" content turn to this platform for entertainment.

The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.

An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.

## Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?

The competition on TikTok is tough. A content creator can publish multiple videos in one day because they're short, as long as they have ideas. So, attracting views with your videos is challenging.

If you can't keep up with how fast-paced other content creators are, you should ensure your videos are of high quality. But what if you run out of ideas?

That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.
