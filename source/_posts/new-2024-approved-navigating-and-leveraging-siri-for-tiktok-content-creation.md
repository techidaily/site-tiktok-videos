TikTok has had numerous trends, and out of all, one trend that is gaining a lot of popularity is the text-to-speech audio effect. For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand **how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.**

02 [How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?](#part2)

03 [TikTok Voice Changer Apps](#part3)

## Part 1: What is Siri Voice?

Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.

You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that's because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out **how to do Siri voice on TikTok** without any hassle in the next part!

## Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?

To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:

**Step 1:** Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.

**Step 2:** Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.

**Step 3:** Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.

**Step 4:** Now, begin writing something on the screen.

**Step 5:** Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.

**Step 6:** Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text. Now, upload the videos, and that's it. All done!

## Part 3: Don't Like the Siri Voice on TikTok? Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps

If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let's throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok's text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.

But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin' accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.

If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.
