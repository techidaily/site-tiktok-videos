## Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Mac OS

TikTok users like you flock to the app due to its entertainment value, global reach, and ease of use. When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.

The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.

1. You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.

2. Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.

3. Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.

4. After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.

6. Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.

Just remember, you must be well aware of using hashtags, as these are proven to be the most reliable for marketing your brand (especially if you are planning to launch a product or looking for a brand awareness campaign).

These **TikTok hashtags** are going to act as your voice to the large mass of people. Also, **TikTok hashtags** are the medium to let users know or link your new posts to the previous posts or create a proper link for the complete set of posts. Thus, they automatically boost your user base across the world for the newly created or modified content/media files.

**Additional Tip (Relevant to you):**

* There should be the right amount of Hashtags (Do not cluster them; 2-3 hashtags per post is sufficient.)
* Relevant Hashtags (**TikTok Hashtags** should be related to your content)
* Create a Brand Hashtag (and keep them short and simple)
