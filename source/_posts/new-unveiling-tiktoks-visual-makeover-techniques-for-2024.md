Wondershare Filmora is one of the most popular video editing software among YouTubers. With the latest Auto-Reframe feature, you can create social media videos easier and faster. With Filmora, you can [change backgrounds in your videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in various ways, with or without a green screen.

The Human Segmentation effect in Filmora's AI Portrait lets you eliminate people from a movie's background instead of using a green screen. It needs a very few mouse clicks, and it works the best when there are people next to the camera.

After you've eliminated the background, you'll be able to see the primary foreground of your video in live time. You can then supplement your actual video with a picture or a background. You can also use the video without the background as an intermediate layer on top of another video. Follow the below steps to change the video background using this feature:

**Step 1: Import Video to Timeline**

Launch Filmora on your Windows PC or Mac, and then import the video to the timeline by clicking on the **File** and then **Import Media**.

**Step 2: Apply Human Segmentation**

Go to **Effects** and then select the **AI Portrait** to see all of the AI Portrait effects. Move the human segmentation effect to the video timeline.
