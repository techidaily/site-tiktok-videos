### 6\. Cartoon PFP for TikTok

Cartoon PFPs are highly popular on TikTok. Users find any cartoon character that they enjoy or relate to and will use it as an image of that character. So, you can use the same for your account. You can also give it a Twist by taking an image that is related to your business and giving it a cartoonish look.

### 7\. Transparent PFP for TikTok

A transparent profile picture can cause your followers to take a second look. It lets your followers watch a video through the picture. Thus, it provides a unique viewing experience. All you have to do is remove the background from the photo and head over to TikTok to upload it.

## Part 4: How to Customize PFP on TikTok?

1. The first thing you have to do is import the file you would like to customize into the Media Library.
2. Using Filmora, you will be able to do some editing, such as rotate, trim, brighten, split, merge, and a lot more. The tool comes with some interesting editing features for you to take advantage of. You have to drag the photo you want to edit along with the elements you want to add to the photo. Make sure that you are adjusting the elements properly.
3. You can check the result by clicking on the Play option present in the Preview window. In case you are happy with the outcome, you can move on to the next step.
4. When you are done editing the picture, you have to click on the ‘Export’ button for the output. Since you will only be able to upload your PFP through your Android or iOS smartphone, you have to choose a device present on the Export Window’s left panel and then select the device.

However, you should know that exporting is not going to transfer your photo to your TikTok account. You will have to add your newly customized photo to your profile from your mobile device.

### Conclusion

From **cool PFP for TikTok** to cute ones, this guide will help you create what you need. Keep in mind to make them stand out; you don’t have to use your own photo. Use any photo but make sure it is not scary.
