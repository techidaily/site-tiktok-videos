Part 1: What is Stream Key?

A stream key is a combination of random letters and numbers which stores the information of your account. It allows different streaming software to live stream your video on your preferred platform. To use streaming software such as OBS Studio for live streaming, the stream key will help you connect with your preferred platform.

If you are using the YouTube platform, its stream key will consist of all the related information, such as login details and permissions. That's why you should keep the streaming key of your platform confidential. Thus, the stream key can prevent you from hassle as you don’t have to sign in with your YouTube account on OBS Studio for live streaming.
