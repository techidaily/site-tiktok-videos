# TikTok Shadowban: How to Get Unshadowbanned on Tiktok

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Fame is a very fickle friend. Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?

While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to **TikTok shadowban**.

Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community.

## Part 1: What is a Shadowban On TikTok?

The word “shadowban” is relatively self-explanatory. Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.

Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the **For You** page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.

The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.

## Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?

At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.

Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.

![tiktok shadowban](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png)

## Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?

The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.

During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:

* be visible in the search results
* be visible on the feed
* receive new followers
* receive likes from others
* receive comments from others

## Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?

TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.

Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.

![shadowbanned on tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png)

**Spam Behavior**

The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.

If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.

**Inappropriate Content**

Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.

The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:

* hate speech
* fake news
* violence
* nudity
* drugs
* copyrighted music

TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.

## Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?

Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:

#### Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok

Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.

#### Switch to A Pro Account

When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.

![tiktok pro account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg)

#### Delete Offensive Content

You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.

#### Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime

Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.

#### Post Original, Innovative Content

When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.

Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.

#### Know Your Audience More

These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.

Fame is a very fickle friend. Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?

While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to **TikTok shadowban**.

### Conclusion

TikTok is an effective marketing tool. Although it might seem easy to become famous and get viral on TikTok, keep in mind to use the social media platform wisely. It is better to create content that abides by TikTok’s community guidelines and post entertaining content that resonates with your audience.

Fame is a very fickle friend. Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?

While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to **TikTok shadowban**.

Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.

Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and **how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok**? Check out below.

## Part 1: What is a Shadowban On TikTok?

The word “shadowban” is relatively self-explanatory. Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.

Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the **For You** page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.

The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.

## Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?

At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.

Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.

![tiktok shadowban](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png)

## Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?

The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.

During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:

* be visible in the search results
* be visible on the feed
* receive new followers
* receive likes from others
* receive comments from others

## Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?

TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.

Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.

![shadowbanned on tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png)

**Spam Behavior**

The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.

If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.

**Inappropriate Content**

Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.

The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:

* hate speech
* fake news
* violence
* nudity
* drugs
* copyrighted music

TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.

## Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?

Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:

#### Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok

Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.

#### Switch to A Pro Account

When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.

![tiktok pro account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg)

#### Delete Offensive Content

You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.

#### Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime

Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.

#### Post Original, Innovative Content

When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.

Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.

#### Know Your Audience More

These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.
