[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The newest editing options to make your TikTok videos stand out include:

* **Motion Tracking:** Now, you can add a Hollywood-style effect to your video with the simple motion tracking feature by Filmora. The motion tracking icon is now right above the timeline. Just select an object or person to track and click the icon. As easy as that. Track an athlete on the race track or follow a ship in its journey.
* **Audio Ducking:** Fade or lower the background audio so that the dialogue you want to focus on stands out. Audio ducking introduces a dramatic effect to your video. Using this feature also ensures a professional outlook. The technique might seem sophisticated but is actually a one-click process. Just select the clip you want to audio-focus and click **Adjust Audio**.
* **Keyframing:** Now, you can animate your videos by using pre-sets. If you want to customize your animations, you can do it in just a few taps. Rotate, zoom, or change the position of the video in any way you like.
* **Color Matching:** One of the most important editing features. One-click color match allows you to copy color from one video to another. This feature will give your clips a consistent look. You can even save a color-corrected template for further use.
* **Dark/Light Interface:** It doesn't matter what time of the day (or night) it is. Select the model that suits you.

## Conclusion

There you go. Now you are well aware of how to save TikTok videos to your gallery. Say goodbye to days of worry when you feared losing your favorite videos. They can now rest safe and sound in your gallery to be watched whenever you like. No matter which method you use to save the videos, it will only take a couple of minutes, and bam! Saved.

But if you want to go the extra mile and make an exciting TikTok video with cool effects, Wondershare Filmora is the app that comes to mind. You don't even have to learn to use the app, follow the steps, and the user-friendly interface will help you create a mind-blowing video in no time.
