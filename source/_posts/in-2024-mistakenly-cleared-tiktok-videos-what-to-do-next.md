## Mistakenly Cleared TikTok Videos: What to Do Next

TikTok's search box, it turns out, can discover videos you've viewed previously; the feature is just a little hidden. TikTok is a passive pastime for the majority of us. You don't have to hunt for videos; they find you as you **accidentally refreshed TikTok**. If you've ever attempted to use the search function to discover anything other than a particular author, you've probably had a difficult time. On your "For You" tab, you'll sometimes see a video that sticks out from the others. It's difficult to discover it again if you forgot to like it or accidentally refreshed your "For You" page. There are just too many videos on the site for you to have a chance of finding one in particular, particularly if the video is related to a popular subject.

## Part 1\. How to Find Videos You Have Seen When Accidentally Refreshed

TikTok is a bottomless hole of addiction, with each video algorithmically crafted to your preferences and interests. Astonishingly, losing only one of the countless important videos flashing past your face is such a tragedy. But it is; there is no greater annoyance than watching a video and then unintentionally refreshing your feed and seeing it go forever. So, **what to do if you accidentally refreshed TikTok**? Let’s find out the solutions available here. Unless you know where to look for it.

### **Method 1\. Find Videos in Liked If You Have Liked the Videos**

* Log in to Your TikTok Account:

As with most things, the first step in discovering the most popular videos on TikTok is to launch the TikTok app on your phone or any other device with excellent internet access and log in with your TikTok account.

* Select Your Profile By Tapping On It:

After you've done so, you'll notice that you're presented TikTok videos on the TikTok homepage, and on that screen alone, you'll see an icon labeled "Profile," which you must choose to proceed.

![Edit Profile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-1.jpg)

* Tap the Liked Icon:

After clicking the profile button, your profile page will appear, with all of your details displayed. Below your name and username, you will see three icons, the middle of which will resemble a heart in some ways and which you must tap to find your liked videos on TikTok.

![Tab Like Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-2.jpg)

* Find the Videos:

When you press on that icon, you'll notice that a grid view of all the thumbnails of the TikTok videos you've liked appears below it. And there you have it! You've discovered your favorite TikTok videos.

### **Method 2\. Find Videos in the Watched History**

You may use filters to narrow down your search using this option. "Watched videos, during the previous 7 days" is the only filter we're interested in under Activity. This filter only displays search results for videos you've seen, which is a mind-boggling choice if you're like me. I had no idea TikTok was keeping track of such videos. When you applied the filter, though, my video was the first to appear. After years of using software that simply erases these victims of the refresh button from existence, it seems a bit strange, but it works.

## Part 2\. What to Do to Prevent Video Loss When Accidentally Refreshed

TikTok is a well-known social networking platform. It was the first in its category to include a feature that allows users to express their creative ideas via short movies of up to a minute in length. Creators may also leverage TikTok Videos' built-in capabilities to make their material even more interesting and appealing. You may also learn how to use TikTok Videos to create slow-motion effects. However, in this post, we'll show you how to locate your favorite videos on TikTok quickly and easily. Like the Video, Share It, And Subscribe to TikToker:

### Do Not Manually Refresh

You may double-tap the heart symbol to like any video, and you can browse all of your favorite videos later by clicking the heart button in your profile area. You should now see TikTok content from the people you've selected to follow. You'll find it on the for you tab if you're seeking material from folks you haven't followed yet (FYP). The for you page is ideal if you want to lose yourself in hours of material. All you have to do is swipe, and fresh stuff will display on your screen. You can also favorite any video by long-pressing it or clicking the share symbol and then "Add to Favorites." By selecting the "Bookmark" symbol in the profile area, you may access all of your favorite videos.

![Add to Favorites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-5.jpg)

## Part 3\. How to Refresh TikTok Manually?

When you first open your TikTok app, you'll be sent to the For You tab, which is a page that is specifically created for each user to watch videos based on their previous activity. Use the search box at the top of the Discover tab to seek subjects you're interested in. TikTok gave me all the top videos for "Science" when I initially put it into the search field. I could have browsed through the choices for users, hashtags, and more if I wanted to learn more.

This strategy is a simple way to locate a range of videos with distinct hashtags and music, as opposed to looking at popular sounds and themes. Following the makers and like the videos (by clicking the heart-shaped "like" icon on the side).

* To do so, browse down your stream for videos that interest you, and when you find one that you like, like it and go on to the next.

![For You](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-6.jpg)

* When you encounter a sort of video that you don't want to view again, press down on the screen until a little menu appears with the option to choose 'Not interested.' To go to the next video, choose this option.

![Not Interested](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-7.jpg)

* You may also hide videos you don't want to watch in the future by using the 'More >' setting next to 'Not interested.'

The problem of TikTok not updating the follower's page has been plaguing users for quite some time. Unfortunately, it seems that this is a TikTok-related mistake. If you're new to TikTok and haven't yet followed someone, you're probably seeking someone to watch. When you initially start, the trending creator's page displays a large number of celebrities for you to check out. This is offered to assist new users to have a better understanding of TikTok and how it works while they get their bearings. If you're not a new user, though, this should not show instead on the next page. Instead of seeing their material when you follow creators, you should see their content.

## Conclusion

There is no time restriction on how long this block will persist, however, it will depend on how many times this issue happens. If you make a mistake, the error should go fast. Because of the large number of videos submitted, they must automate this procedure, which often results in errors. After you find that ‘**I was watching a TikTok and accidentally refreshed**’ then with this guide, you may easily retrieve your videos from your TikTok profile page. Finally, try searching for one or two of these exact terms if you're looking for a certain video and recall anything about its captioning. This will display all of the movies you've seen in the last seven days that have this term in the text, making it quicker to browse through while looking for a certain video. You may use the approaches mentioned above to get close to your objective.

We've enlisted these **Amazon finds on TikTok** with daily product updates, consisting of practical Amazon things and fun, creative devices, with a few humorous pieces of stuff thrown in! We've given you a sneak peek inside our Amazon cart if you're searching for some of the top stuff.

Depending on the sort of TikTok video you watch, you may already have a couple of our recommended products in your Amazon shop.

Dip a sponge into a tiny bit of the miraculous paste, apply some elbow grease, and have a sparkling clean house smelling like fresh berries.

## Parlovable Cross-Band Slippers:

These wildly popular slippers are like a cloud for your feet. They had over 15,000 Amazon reviews, but Tinx pushed them on TikTok, giving them an additional boost. She said, "I don't remember who I was before this footwear." It's now one of the most popular TikTok items.

## Smile Satin Headscarf:

We can all agree that an adaptable product has a place in our closets (and hearts). Bandanas and silk scarves, in particular, can be worn as strapless shirts, purse embellishments, hair ties, and more, which is why this $9 scarf has TikTok users flaunting their finest looks.

## Pavoi 14-Karat-Gold Chunky Hoops:

A pair of massive gold hoop earrings should be part of everyone's jewelry collection, and TikTok-ers have made it even simpler with this under $20 set from Amazon. These Pavoi hoop earrings are a fantastic imitation of Hailey Bieber's, Jennifer Lopez's, and other celebrities' favorite styles.

## Pleated Skater Tennis Skirt:

Tennis attire was the summer 2018 trend, but it's making a return, as seen by this tennis skirt. The versatile skirt goes with anything from a crop top to a button-down cardigan to a bomber jacket, among other things, which is why TikTok users can't get enough of it.

## The Drop Women's Melanie Mini Bag:

We're big fans of baguette bags (you've undoubtedly seen them in a lot of our tales...). And Amazon's baguette bags have swiftly taken over TikTok, with clip artists displaying a range of fashions. This classic croc-embossed shoulder bag is ideal for anything from the day to date night.

## CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser:

Hyram Yabro, aka Skincare by Hyram, a TikTok beauty influencer, single-handedly sold out CeraVe's Hydrating Facial Cleanser. As we previously reported, the brand's sales increased so dramatically in the prior year that CNN Business covered it. While ceramides and hyaluronic acid replenish and moisturize the skin's barrier, the mild cleanser eliminates debris and makeup.

Do you like a layered look? Just in time for autumn, TikTok users have the ideal solution: It's simple to put on a sweatshirt or sweater and go about your day with this false collar.

We like '90s fashion as much as you do, and TikTok users can't get enough of the Amazon treasures they can use to recreate looks. Exhibit A: these Amazon-exclusive velvet scrunchies with a surprise within.

## Windshield Sun Shade:

Get this retractable windshield Sunshade for yourself. The sunshades' exterior layer is constructed of a highly reflecting, anti-ultraviolet material that protects the environment. As a consequence of the sun's rays being reflected, the temperature inside the automobile drops. The substantial insulation provided by these shades helps to delay the aging of interior components, allowing them to remain in top condition for longer. Furthermore, these windshields are exceptionally simple to use and can be placed and removed in less than a minute without the need for any additional equipment. They may also be readily stored since they are small and fold into an almost undetectable line. It also secures itself in place, reducing the risk of it sliding off.

## Revlon Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Face Roller:

Do you have extra-oily skin? Revlon's Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Roller demonstrations on TikTok reveal some stunning before-and-after results. The volcanic stone removes the extra shine from your face without removing your makeup—think of it as an upgraded version of your oil-blotting sheets that you won't have to change as often.

## Big Hair Claw Clips:

This year, claw clips have probably taken over your Instagram page more times than you can count. People everywhere (but particularly on TikTok) are eager to pull their hair back while they're on the road, and the '90s fashion is back in full force. We love the bright colors of this pair of huge clips, which are perfect for medium to long hair.

## Acupressure Mat and Pillow:

Acupressure relieves muscular tension all across the body, and it's easy to do at home using pressure mats. Intrigued? This mat and cushion combo, which enables you to touch various pressure points while reclining on your back, is a TikTok favorite.

## Wireless Charger Disinfection Box:

One of the high-quality TikTok Amazon must-haves is the Lecone Cell Phone Sanitizer and Wireless Charger Disinfection Box. It offers a three-in-one function that incorporates a wireless device charger, a disinfection box, and aromatherapy. The cleaning procedure takes just 18 minutes and is therefore quite quick. This gadget is capable of cleaning your whole phone. It includes a Qi feature and can suit any phone with a screen size of fewer than 6.2 inches. This gadget is multipurpose since it can disinfect and aromatherapy tiny objects that may be lying about accumulating germs while also charging your phone.

## Ydaowkn Classic Vintage Aviator Sunglasses:

This year's sunglasses colors are black and orange, and TikTok users immediately made this inexpensive pair of aviators go viral. Plus, despite wearing one of the season's greatest trends, the huge vintage sunnies will only cost you back $13.

## Foot Peel Mask:

Most people do not consider wearing a foot mask, yet it is something that everyone should do at least once in their lives. This foot mask combines exclusive Aloe Vera and Strawberry extracts to eradicate foot odor while also increasing the suppleness of your feet by four times. It contains strong and nutritious ingredients that instantly soften your foot. This foot mask may remove calluses and cracks from the deepest layers of your skin, leaving your skin supple. It has undergone dermatological testing and is completely vegan. It may also de-cleanse your skin without totally removing the moisture; instead, it gives deep hydration that leaves your skin feeling wonderful.
