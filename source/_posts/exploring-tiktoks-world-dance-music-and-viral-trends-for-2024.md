The continent of Africa is so big that it's hard to generalize about its cuisine, or even to group its cuisines into categories. Even within individual countries or regions, you will find an astonishing variety of foods and flavors.

But there are some common themes that run through most African cuisines:

A preference for starchy staples – such as rice, yams, millet, sorghum, and maize (corn) – paired with sauces made from local ingredients such as tomatoes, leafy greens, peppers, and beans.

### ● Jollof rice

Nigerian jollof rice is one of the country's most popular dishes, and it's become a staple on TikTok. Jollof rice is a rice dish made with tomatoes, green peppers, onion, and spices like ginger, garlic, paprika, and black pepper.

It can be served as a side dish or as a meal with additional ingredients. Some users have added sausages and fried plantains to their jollof rice before serving.

### ● Suya

It’s another popular African food called TikTok. Suya is a snack that can be found all over Nigeria and West Africa. It consists of skewers of meat covered in peanut butter and spices like ginger powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, vegetable oil, and bouillon cubes. The meat can be made from any cut of beef or chicken but traditionally uses beef steak or chicken thigh filet.

### ● Fufu

Fufu is a soft white dough made from cassava or yams flour (also known as cassava flour). It may also be made from plantain or cocoyam. Fufu is normally eaten with stews and soups like Peanut Soup in Ghana, Egusi Soup in Nigeria, etc.

### ● Braai

Braai comes from South Africa's BBQ tradition and is an important part of social gatherings in South Africa. There are several kinds of meat cooked on a grill such as steak, chicken, pork chops, sausages, etc.

## Conclusion

After a long, hard day of work, you simply can’t imagine what to eat. Doesn’t matter if you are exhausted, stressed out, or even in a bad mood; food is the magic elixir that can make your day or spoil it completely.

Eating a tasty meal is one way to relieve stress and refresh yourself. If you need some inspiration for your next cuisine from another country, you will find this collection of popular foods on TikTok very helpful.
