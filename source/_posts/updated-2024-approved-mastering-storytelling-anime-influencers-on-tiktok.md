### [Let’s Groove:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/lets-groove-jojo)

This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind & Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.

### [Trending dances:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-dance?lang=en)

TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.

### [Prada Bucket challenge:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/prada-challenge?lang=en)

This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.

### [Glow-ups:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/biggest-anime-glow-ups?lang=en)

At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.

### [Anime Edits:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/edits-anime?lang=en)

If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.

### [Edgy humor:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/edgy-humor)

There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.

### [Making TikToks with Your Family:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Making-an-anime-family)

This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.

Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.

### [Seamless Transitions:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-smooth-transitions)

Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.

Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it's safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.

### [Documenting a Day in The Life:](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Documenting-Life)

While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that "no one wants to see your avocado toast," the truth is that a lot of people do.

## Part 4: Conclusion

Sometimes all that TikTok needs is an update. Someone else has undoubtedly run across whatever difficulty you are having earlier and the developer may have published an update that fixes the problem already. If none of the alternatives above work, remove your **TikTok app** according to your device. Go to the App Store or Google Play Store. Search for the **TikTok** **application** and install it. If you are on an Android smartphone, go to the Play Store, search for TikTok, and check if there is an update available. For an iOS device, visit the App Store, press on your profile symbol, then scroll down to check if there's an update. Summing up, these are the few reliable ways to fix your **TikTok bugs** handily.

Part 2\. Types of TikTok Bugs Leads to TikTok Not Working

On TikTok’s side, the TikTok issues might be caused by glitches or flaws in the software. There may also be an issue with TikTok’s server resulting in TikTok problems. Regular updates generally solve issues on the TikTok app. Some mistakes are more prevalent than others. While others emerge relatively infrequently. Although, the more familiar the issue, the more readily it may be rectified. However, for unusual TikTok issues, you need to become more technical or obtain assistance from official sources like customer support. TikTok faults might come from both your side and from TikTok. Locally, your settings might mix up with the app resulting in TikTok issues. Other applications in your phone might potentially interact with TikTok resulting in multiple TikTok failures.

You can correct common mistakes easily, and we will show you how. Here is a list of recurrent TikTok faults that you discover every day:

* TikTok is not connecting to the internet.
* TikTok is not loading videos.
* Not saving videos.
* TikTok app is crashing regularly.
* TikTok video not functioning after sharing.
* The app is not letting me log in.
* TikTok server is not responding.
* TikTok is not removing my account.
* Not removing my video.

If you experience a frequent mistake like the **TikTok bugs** mentioned above, you’re in luck. We could just have the answer for them in this tutorial.

### 1\. Fix TikTok Bugs on Android

The major cause of this condition is excessive video watching. As a consequence, TikTok collects additional caches, which are kept in the phone memory. As result, there is not enough capacity to conserve phone data, hence TikTok videos are slow, and there are crashing and hanging difficulties.

The remedy to this issue is to clean the TikTok app's caches and data. This approach is based on the steps indicated below:

* Launch the TikTok app.
* Go to your profile page and select one of the three possibilities indicated by three dots.

### 2\. Fix TikTok Not Working on iPhone

To begin, we suggest resetting the **TikTok iOS** app as a general approach. Temporary difficulties that emerged during the app’s functioning may be fixed with a simple restart. As a consequence, these app problems might be to fault for any troubles with getting into your TikTok account. Plus, this is an excellent step to attempt after other changes to begin a fresh new session of the TikTok platform.

To Restart Your **TikTok iOS App**:

* First, close the TikTok app entirely by deleting it from your Recent Apps or App Switcher.
* Then, from your homepage, reopen the TikTok app.

### 3\. Fix TikTok Bugs on Chrome

Alternatively, you may try going to TikTok.com in a web browser (ideally on another device) and check whether it loads and operates correctly. If it does not, chances are that the problem is not with your phone and there is an outage of some type.

![Login Tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-3.jpg)

* First, try shutting the app completely altogether and relaunching it. This looks to be a simple remedy for some customers.

* If comments still aren’t functioning after a restart, users can try logging out and back in.
* As a final option, you may remove the software totally and re-download it for a reinstall.

### 4\. Clear TikTok App Cache

If your TikTok app is not operating, it's probably an issue with damaged cache data. If you notice, your TikTok app plays certain videos offline when you start it. It's not magic. The cache memory saves certain data temporarily to let the software operate quicker and function effectively. If your TikTok is acting improperly, deleting the cached data may help solve it. Follow the instructions below to do so.

* Launch the Settings app from your app menu, then click on the Apps & Notifications.

* From there, click on the option to see all applications. Usually "App details", "Manage Applications", or "See all apps".

![Clear Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-5.jpg)

* Finally, press Clear cache to delete the stored data. Now touch the back button once and tap on the Force stop button to quit the TikTok app. After that, re-launch the TikTok app to see whether it rectifies the issue or try another method below.

### 5\. Reset the Network

TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges. Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:

* Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network > Open ‘Advanced Options’

* Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone's screen.

* Then click on reset to default. After performing these instructions leave the settings, then go to your home screen and switch on the mobile data. Then play the video to see whether the fault is fixed.

### 6\. Restart the Devices

If TikTok works on another device or browser from the list above, your device seems to be the issue. If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users. The first thing to do in the case of an application problem on your iPhone device is to switch off then on again. To achieve this, these are the steps to follow:

**For iOS:**

* To begin, touch and hold the Power button until you receive the “Slide to Power Off” option on your screen. Then move the slider to the right until the screen on your iPhone or iPad becomes dark.

* Wait at least 10 seconds after shutting off your iPhone before hitting and holding the Power button until the Apple logo shows on the screen.
