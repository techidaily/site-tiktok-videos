Garlic has a bad reputation due to the unpleasant effects it leaves on your breath. However, it is a small price to pay for this taste. In a container with a lid, place some drained and pickled garlic, a little thyme, a generous amount of sriracha, and chili powder. Shake it up and you have your delicious snack.
