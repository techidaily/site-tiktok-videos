Videos containing open-ended questions have gained in popularity with the advent of the stitch.

Whenever you Stitch a clip-on TikTok, you are essentially inserting your video after yet another video that has already been submitted. People frequently utilize this to remark on or reply to other videos. And, when done well, it can add a lot more context to your movies.

The one limitation of the Stitch tool is that you may only publish **up to five seconds** from some other video. So, if you're focusing on a Stitch, you must select the five seconds which are most critical to highlight your message.

## Part 4: How to Stitch Any TikTok Video with [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?

Before getting started, understand why people opt for Filmora video editor for stitching videos on TikTok when this can be done through the official TikTok application.

One more reason is that, with TikTok, you cannot stitch the already existing video from the camera roll, which restricts creators from adding the already edited content to the existing video. So, to avoid the above problems, Filmora is used for stitching TikTok videos.

## Part 5: FAQs About TikTok Video Stitch

No, it is not possible to stitch a video for longer than five seconds using the built-in Stitching feature of the TikTok app. But this can be done by stitching the videos using third-party applications and software.

Users may choose whether or not someone else can Stitch their work in their settings.
