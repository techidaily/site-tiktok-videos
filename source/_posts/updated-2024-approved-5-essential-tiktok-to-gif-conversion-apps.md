### Prerequisites of Going Live on TikTok

Before learning how to invite others on TikTok, let's shed light on the requirements of going live on this social app. The reason is that not everyone can go for live streaming on TikTok, as there are certain restrictions you need to keep in your mind.

* To start live streaming on your TikTok, you should have at least 1000 followers.
* You should be 16 years old or above to access the live stream feature.
* To use virtual gifts during a live stream on TikTok, you should be 18 years old or above.

### Steps to Invite Others to Join Your Live on TikTok Easily

Are you excited to invite your fan to your live stream on TikTok? Check the below steps to invite others to join your TikTok live:

##### Step1 Go to the Live Option

Open your TikTok app on your mobile phone. After opening it, tap on the "Live" option from the right side. Now you can add a title to your TikTok Live.

##### Step2 Invite your Desired User

After adding the title, tap on the "Go Live" button. Once the live streaming initiates, you have to press the "Pink Blue Circle" icon from the bottom left corner. It will open a list of the suggested users. Select the preferred user you want to invite and tap on the "Invite" button. Your selected user will have 20 seconds to accept or reject your request.
