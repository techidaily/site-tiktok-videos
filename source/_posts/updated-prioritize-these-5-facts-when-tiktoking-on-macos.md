## Humor Highlights: TikTok's Funniest Newcomers

As with all social media websites, Tiktok was also introduced for the purpose of entertainment. Although it has become a platform for much more than enjoyment, its main purpose still serves to be joy.

Tiktok trends and funny videos have gone through the roof in recent years. People from all around the world pick up any topic, splash some humor on it and post it for the rest of the world to see.

In this article, we will list the top Tiktok comedy trends and stars you must follow!

## Tiktok Comedy Trends

Tiktok videos have a way of becoming trends pretty easily. Users tend to add sass and humor to anything and everything and turn it into a trend. Then everyone gets onto the bandwagon, and we see our FYP flooding with different versions of the same trend.

Over the years, we have seen many Tiktok comedy trends that have made us laugh our hearts out. Let’s take a look at some of the best ones.

### 1\. Poking Fun at Life Hacks

This trend started out with Khaby Lame, who posted a video during the pandemic where he poked fun at a life hack video. Eventually, many people caught on and started making videos where they would try absurd hacks, which never worked.

### 2\. Zoom Meeting Mishaps

Zoom meeting mishaps are one of the most hilarious trends that took TikTok by storm. In the initial pandemic phase, people were getting accustomed to the online world where using zoom was a big challenge for a lot of us. Click [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@jeffyracks/video/6806680007990070534?is%5Fcopy%5Furl=1&is%5Ffrom%5Fwebapp=v1) to see a mishap.
