You can use TikTok on your Mac through the official website of TikTok.

![log-in-to-TikTok-web](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tiktok-web.jpg)

We would like to add that when you are using TikTok on your Mac, you can upload already edited videos without any trouble. There is not one specified Tiktok video editing software available but you can utilize Wondershare Filmora for Mac as that seems to be the top choice among users these days.

## 2. What Should You Do if TikTok Web Stops Functioning Properly?

The technology behind TikTok is pretty much flawless. If the website is not working, then we would recommend:

1. That you check your internet connection. A stable internet connection will give you the best user experience.
2. If the website is still is not loading then go to the browser’s settings and clear out related caches and cookies.

If you are facing some other kind of problem then you can always directly contact the support team at TikTok.

1. Go to your profile by clicking on **Me**.![titok me screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/TikTok-Me-Screen-.png)
2. You will see **Three dots** which will take you to the option of **Report a problem**.
3. You will be asked to look for the solution to your problem by looking into the existing suggested topics.
4. If your issue is not listed there then click on **No** when asked: “if your problem has been resolved”. The company will contact you shortly afterward to solve your matter.

2. If the friend that you are looking for also uses Facebook then you would be able to find and connect with them easily.
