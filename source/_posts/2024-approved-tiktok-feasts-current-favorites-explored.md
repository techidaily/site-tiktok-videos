So, whenever any user clicks on the particular hashtags, those users will directly be able to see your video content, media file, or will get directed to your content area. Thus, giving your post a boost. Hence this is how to get views on TikTok.

#### Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day

#### Tip 3: ‘For You’ page

Another valuable trick is to involve/include the front page, 'For You' page for the users.

So, when any user lands on your page, they will get the content of interest, enhancing their chances of revisiting your profile. Also, you will get an idea of what is the most liked video on TikTok.

#### Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends

Preparing a video or media for the TikTok profile is a good idea, but posting some exciting content along with your friend is a beautiful idea. That will double the chance of getting the more viewer list of your TikTok account. Even you will see that taking the collaboration or help of your friends to create the content will make the video more interactive and exciting.

#### Tip 5: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments
