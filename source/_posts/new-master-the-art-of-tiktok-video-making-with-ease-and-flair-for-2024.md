Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos

TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for "bite-sized" content turn to this platform for entertainment.

The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.

An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.

## Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?

The competition on TikTok is tough. A content creator can publish multiple videos in one day because they're short, as long as they have ideas. So, attracting views with your videos is challenging.

If you can't keep up with how fast-paced other content creators are, you should ensure your videos are of high quality. But what if you run out of ideas?

That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.

## Part 1: Does TikTok Tell You Who Viewed Your Profile?

The answer is NO. TikTok lacks a feature that allows users to see which accounts have viewed their videos. It means that while you may not see who is viewing your videos, your viewing habits are also left anonymous. Thus, you wouldn't be able to access the TikTok profile view.

TikTok only indicates how many people viewed the post instead of showing who has viewed your videos profile.

TikTok users can see who comments on their videos as well as who creates "duets" or "stitches" (essentially video edits) of their content using the **Activity** tab on the app.

## Part 2: How to View Someone's TikTok Profile without them Knowing?

To view someone's profile without them knowing, you need to upgrade to the latest updated TikTok app. TikTok will only indicate the number of viewers but no further information on who those viewers are.

It means you are already viewing others' TikTok profiles without them knowing.

## Part 3: How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok

You've got only two ways to represent yourself on TikTok with your profile picture and videos. Of course, the profile picture you put shows up on the profile page and every video posted.

Like many other apps, your profile icon can get changed whenever you feel like it. TikTok has an added advantage since it gives more options for changing your icon. You can have a profile video.

Additionally, there's an easy way to download a profile picture you like on someone else's profile.

**Steps to change your profile picture on TikTok**

You can pick a photo you have saved or take a new one when you change your picture. Make sure you've kept the image you wish to upload before proceeding.

Step 1: Open TikTok and head to your profile by tapping the Profile option in the bottom-right corner.

## Part 4: How to Edit TikTok Profile on PC (Include already uploaded TikTok)?

On the already updated TikTok, it is impossible to change the profile picture on PC because it is limited. The only possible way to make changes is through an Android or iOS device. However, if using a PC and need to make those changes, you can use TikTok on BlueStacks with zero troubles.

BlueStacks acts as an android emulator, which enables the running of the TikTok mobile app on the PC. You will only need to save the video or image on BlueStacks by using the option 'Save to Album.' For all this to be possible, first update the graphics driver and allocate a minimum of 1500MB RAM. After opening the app, navigate to the 'App Centre' then sign in with your Google account. Type 'TikTok' and then click it to install and open at the search option.

## Part 4: How to Edit TikTok Profile on PC (Include already uploaded TikTok)?

On the already updated TikTok, it is impossible to change the profile picture on PC because it is limited. The only possible way to make changes is through an Android or iOS device. However, if using a PC and need to make those changes, you can use TikTok on BlueStacks with zero troubles.

BlueStacks acts as an android emulator, which enables the running of the TikTok mobile app on the PC. You will only need to save the video or image on BlueStacks by using the option 'Save to Album.' For all this to be possible, first update the graphics driver and allocate a minimum of 1500MB RAM. After opening the app, navigate to the 'App Centre' then sign in with your Google account. Type 'TikTok' and then click it to install and open at the search option.

## Part 5: How to Optimize TikTok Profile in 2022?

At the initial stage, it is normal not to get more likes and views on TikTok. For changing this position, you need to apply little smartness and effort to emerge victorious in this race. Inescapably by using new tactics, coming across the crowd with the victorious song will be a swift game to you. So, follow the tips we will share here carefully, and in no time, you can be one of those whose accounts with multiple followers. With a bit of patience in your hand, let's start reading the suggestions one by one with complete confidence to learn about the most liked video on TikTok.

**Tip 1: Adding Tags**

Despite adding Tags sounding simpler, it gives prodigious results for uploaded videos or your account. To avoid these unprecedented results, you need to put some valuable hashtags (the symbol "# followed by a short text without space") at the end or in the middle of the post. It tells about the video genre.

As a result, whenever a user clicks on any hashtags, they get to view your video content or file directly. Additionally, they will get to your content area, thereby boosting your post. This is how you get views on TikTok.

**Tip 2: 'For You' page**

Involving/ including the front page is another valuable trick: the users 'For You' page. It would suggest and direct the users' content, videos of their interest based on their search history or essential links. As a result, there will be a range of interests when any user lands on your page.

It will force them to revisit your profile at the end. Additionally, you will get an idea of the most liked video on the TikTok profile, thereby focusing on that department.

**Tip 3: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments**

Your users are the natural source for promoting your profile in the TikTok world. To better know how to get more views and likes on TikTok, you better interact with them as much as possible. Actively write comments. Whenever users visit your profile and see you write regularly, they are most likely to revert to your account or profile.

**Tip 4: Your profile must be complete**

In my view, TikTok profile competition is a very crucial tip as it keeps your profile up-to-date. Leaving a positive impression on users is vital, making it possible. Similarly, whoever lands on your profile will feel the appropriateness of the content. Presenting your profile to users so that it looks attractive and professional is critical nowadays.

**Tip 5: Create original videos**

If you are an active TikToker, you must be aware of the importance of content originality. It is highly advisable to be serious about posting authentic video content. To be outstanding, avoid any piracy and make original videos only.

**Tip 6: Linking TikTok account to other media platforms too like Facebook**

Linking other social media platforms like Facebook to your TikTok account is highly recommended. As a result, whoever visits your Facebook page and clicks on the TikTok link present, will reach your TikTok account, thereby indirectly boosting your account and answering to getting more views on TikTok.

**Tip 7: Use Powerful Video Editing Tool**

## Part 1: Does TikTok Tell You Who Viewed Your Profile?

The answer is NO. TikTok lacks a feature that allows users to see which accounts have viewed their videos. It means that while you may not see who is viewing your videos, your viewing habits are also left anonymous. Thus, you wouldn't be able to access the TikTok profile view.

TikTok only indicates how many people viewed the post instead of showing who has viewed your videos profile.

TikTok users can see who comments on their videos as well as who creates "duets" or "stitches" (essentially video edits) of their content using the **Activity** tab on the app.

## Part 2: How to View Someone's TikTok Profile without them Knowing?

To view someone's profile without them knowing, you need to upgrade to the latest updated TikTok app. TikTok will only indicate the number of viewers but no further information on who those viewers are.

It means you are already viewing others' TikTok profiles without them knowing.

## Part 3: How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok

You've got only two ways to represent yourself on TikTok with your profile picture and videos. Of course, the profile picture you put shows up on the profile page and every video posted.

Like many other apps, your profile icon can get changed whenever you feel like it. TikTok has an added advantage since it gives more options for changing your icon. You can have a profile video.

Additionally, there's an easy way to download a profile picture you like on someone else's profile.

**Steps to change your profile picture on TikTok**

You can pick a photo you have saved or take a new one when you change your picture. Make sure you've kept the image you wish to upload before proceeding.

Step 1: Open TikTok and head to your profile by tapping the Profile option in the bottom-right corner.

Step 2: Tap the Edit profile option.
