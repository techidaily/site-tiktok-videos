## Weaving a Captivating TikTok Closure Narrative

If you're just getting started on TikTok, you might be wondering why people bother with TikTok outros. After all, they're just a few seconds of a clip at the end of your videos. Why not just let the video end and move on?

Well, TikTok outros are actually a really important part of the platform. They're a great way to promote your other social media platforms, give your viewers a call to action, or just show off your personality.

![create outros for tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-outros-for-tiktok.png)

In this article, we'll show you how to **create an outro for TikTok** that is sure to leave an ever-lasting impression on those watching your content. In the end, we'll recommend the best video editors that you can use to make your videos engaging by creating the perfect outros every time.

## Part 1\. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video

The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.

An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.

Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it's important to make it count!

![outros template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png)

### Elements of an Outro

Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:

* **Subscription:** Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it's released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.
* **The Next Video to Watch:** If you have other episodes/parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.
* **Your Social Media Channels:** Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.
* **Use Stunning Visuals:** Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.

### How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?

If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.

To **create a good outro for your TikTok**, follow the below tips:

* Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.
* Keep your outro short and sweet because you don't want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.
* Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.
* Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and/or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.
* Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.
* Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.

## Part 2\. An Excellent Video Editor for Your TikTok Adventure

While popular culture and many influencers might have you believe that TikTok is all about kids lip-syncing to pop songs, there's so much more to this social media platform. Recently, it has become a powerful marketing tool for small to mid-sized businesses.

The best way to use TikTok's platform for marketing is to create engaging outros for your videos. For this, you'll need video editing software like Filmora and a little creative mind. With this program, you can easily add text, music, and effects to your TikTok clips to make them truly stand out.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Whether you love it or hate it, you must have heard about an App in 2020 - TikTok. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, TikTok became one of the fastest-growing apps on both the App Store and Google Play. Teenagers are obsessed with it, but their parents don’t understand it. The government fears it, but companies eager to make money off it. TikTok probably has been the most controversial (and prevalent) social network ever.

What makes TikTok different? Initially, Tiktok is famous for its 15-second short videos, and most of the videos are lip-syncing videos. Gradually, it evolved into a community mixed with music, lip-syncing, and micro-video content. Besides providing access to an impressive music library, the app also offers a rich selection of video editing tools, which makes videos go viral quickly.

However, the US government has threatened to ban TikTok in the US recently after it had been banned in India. The growing uncertainties of TikTok has driven so many users to look for **TikTok alternatives**. In this article, we will go through some of the best options available to both iPhone and Android users.

* [Dubsmash](#part1)
* [Funimate](#part2)
* [Cheez](#part3)
* [Triller](#part4)
* [Likee](#part5)

## Top 5 Alternatives to the TikTok App

Members of TikTok - including the Musical.ly community can't create videos longer than one minute, which can potentially limit their options while recording music videos. What's more, the app's video editing capabilities are somewhat limited, since producing the cloning effect and numerous other effects require you to use more powerful video editing apps. To help you overcome these obstacles, we've selected some of the best music video apps on the market, so here are the five best **alternatives to TikTok**.

#### 1\. [Dubsmash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dubsmash/id918820076?mt=8)

![Dubsmash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dubsmash.png)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

**Price:** Free

It is probably one of the oldest music video apps for Android and iOS-based devices that lost a bit of its former glory with the rise of Musical.ly. The fact that Dubmash has over one hundred million installs speaks volumes about its popularity today. By downloading this app, you're becoming a part of a large community that revolves around entertaining lip-sync videos.

You can use thousands of different sounds in your videos, including movie and TV quotes, which means that you'll always have fresh material for your videos. The app lets you add stickers and text overlays to videos so that you can make even more captivating music videos. The app displays videos in the style of Snapchat stories divided into two news feed sections so you can follow the channels you like and keep track of the latest videos posted by your friends. Besides enabling you to post music videos on your Dumbmash profile, the app lets you share your videos on other social media networks. You can save each video you produce with this app to your camera roll.

Can you believe it? Lots of movie stars are big fans of this app and Penelope Cruz is one of them.
