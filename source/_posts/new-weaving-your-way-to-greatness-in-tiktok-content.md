Before getting started, understand why people opt for Filmora video editor for stitching videos on TikTok when this can be done through the official TikTok application.

One more reason is that, with TikTok, you cannot stitch the already existing video from the camera roll, which restricts creators from adding the already edited content to the existing video. So, to avoid the above problems, Filmora is used for stitching TikTok videos.
