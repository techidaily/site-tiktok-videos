## Make a TikTok video Easily using Filmora

If you look at the built-in video editor of the TikTok app, you will notice that the interface is not user-friendly at all. But this does not mean there is no way to make a TikTok music video. Filmora is an advanced video editor for both Mac and PC that has many features that make it a great choice for TikTok videos. We'll walk you through the process:

**Step 1:** First of all, make sure that the latest version of Filmora Video editor is downloaded on your computer. If you haven't already installed it, you can easily download it from the official website of Wondershare.

**Step 2:** Now, Install the application and run it on your computer.

**Step 3:** A window will appear on your screen where you need to select the new project option.

**Step 4:** In the next step, you need to select the aspect ratio. Keep in mind that by default, the aspect ratio will be 16:9, which is landscape, but since the TikTok videos are in portrait orientation, we need to select 9:16 and click ok.

**Step 5:** Now, you can import the media files to your Filmora library. Just click on the file, select import media, and click on the Import media files. Now select the video files that you want to edit, and they will be imported to your Filmora Library.

**Step 6:** Now, drag the videos from the Library and drop them to your timeline. Once you have the videos in your timeline, you can perform all the edits that you want to perform.

**Step 7:** If you want to add effects to your videos, then you can explore the effects section of Filmora, where you can find hundreds of cool effects to make your videos more interesting. If you like any effect and want to apply it to your video, drag the effect and drop it on the video track in the Filmora timeline.

![make tiktok video with Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tiktok-reaction-video-11.jpg)

**Step 9:** If you are making a TikTok reaction video using Filmora, then you can easily play two videos side-by-side. You need to place two different videos in two different tracks in Filmora. Then select the first video and adjust the size of the video so that it covers the half area in the preview window. Then repeat the septs to cover the other half of the preview window. By doing this, you can easily make a reaction video in just a few minutes.

Adjust the length of the music according to the length of the video, and it will be added to the background. You can also use the volume controls to adjust the loudness.

**Step 11:** Once you are satisfied with your video, all you need to do is export it to your system in your desired format and share it with your audience on TikTok.

## Part 1\. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video

The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.

An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.

Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it's important to make it count!

### Elements of an Outro

Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:

* **Subscription:** Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it's released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.
* **The Next Video to Watch:** If you have other episodes/parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.
* **Your Social Media Channels:** Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.
* **Use Stunning Visuals:** Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.

### How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?

If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.

To **create a good outro for your TikTok**, follow the below tips:

* Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.
* Keep your outro short and sweet because you don't want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.
* Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.
* Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and/or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.
* Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.
* Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.
