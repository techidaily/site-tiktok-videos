 There is a prominent plus sign button in the middle of the screen. You can press and hold that button just like on snapchat for as long as your desire to make your video. There is also a handsfree feature available on the right side of the screen in the shape of a clock. The timer will start and your video will automatically start recording.

 Once you are done with that, there is a “pick soundtrack” option that comes on the top of your screen from which you can pick the song of your liking from the wide variety of songs available in the Tik Tok music album. You can even trim the soundtrack by clicking on the scissor icon and trim it according to your preference. You can even pick a song before recording and mimic that song. There are also video speed options which can help you adjust the speed of your video and soundtrack making it slower or faster

 After that, you can apply filters and even video effect. There is a vast range available which will make your video more creative and fun.

 When you’re completely done with the video, you can select a cover or thumbnail for your video and you are all ready to upload.

 Click next and showcase your fantastic work, add hashtags and catchy captions and gain more likes!
