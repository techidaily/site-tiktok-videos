Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos

TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for "bite-sized" content turn to this platform for entertainment.

The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.

An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.

If you can't keep up with how fast-paced other content creators are, you should ensure your videos are of high quality. But what if you run out of ideas?

That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.
