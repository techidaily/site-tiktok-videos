## Comprehensive Guide to TikTok Triggers

If you’ve just started using Tiktok, I’m sure you’re looking for ways to make your videos interesting so that more and more people view them. You look at videos with millions of views and wonder what it is that they are doing and you are not?

Well, let me tell you a secret!

While the content of the video is the most important thing when it comes to getting views, certain factors contribute to grabbing the attention of the audience. This includes the caption and the cover of your video.

So, if you’re out to make the next big viral video, you’ll need to work a bit on creating a compelling video with a nice caption and an attractive cover.

And that’s why we have compiled a complete guide for Tiktok elements!

## **Tiktok Videos**

So, what is it that you need to make a successful Tiktok video? Let’s have a look:

### **1\. Tiktok Video Requirements**

The first and most important thing that you need to know and understand is the requirement of a Tiktok video. The aspect ratio, the dimension, the orientation, and of course, the length!

**Aspect Ratio:** The majority of the people use Tiktok on their smartphones, so the aspect ratio for a Tiktok video should be 9:16 or 1:1 if there are sidebars.

**Dimension:** The recommended dimension for a Tiktok video is 1080 x 1920.

**Video Orientation:** As mentioned earlier, users usually watch Tiktok videos on their smartphones, so a video with a vertical orientation is much easier to watch compared to a video in landscape mode for which one has to tilt their phones.

**Video Length:** Tiktok videos are usually 15 to 60 seconds long depending on the content, but my advice would be to keep them short, as people usually watch shorter videos till the end and might get bored if the video is too long.

**Video File Size:** The file size for iOS devices is 287.6 MB max, and for Android, it is 72 MB.

**Supported Format:** The video format compatible with Tiktok is MP4 and MOV.

If you keep these basic requirements in mind and make videos that fall within these criteria, I’m sure your videos will be watch-worthy. However, there are other elements to consider as well, like…

### **2\. Best Practices to Make Successful Tiktok Videos**

Tiktok video requirements will help you create videos with the perfect orientation, dimension, and aspect ratio. However, if you want to make videos that get millions of views, go viral, and increase your followers, you must know the best practices to make successful Tiktok videos.

For instance:

**Post Frequently:** If you want to appear on the FYP, you must post often! The more videos you post, the more the chances to come in front of the audience. And, when the audience sees you regularly, they will get acquainted and start following you to see more of your content.

**Follow the Trends:** Tiktok is all about trends. Something goes viral, and everyone starts making the same content to jump on the bandwagon. The trick is to make the same thing in a unique way. Therefore…

**Be Authentic:** The only way you can be unique is to be authentic, be you! If you keep your originality intact even when following the trend, chances are the audience might just click with your content.

**Choose a Niche:** While, Tiktok is known for having all sorts of video content, ranging from comedy, to sad, to just being motivational, you need to find something you’re good at. For instance, if you can sing well, you can post videos of you singing famous songs. Or, if you can paint well, you can post videos of you painting something. You will reach the right audience, and they will follow you!

If you ask me, I could watch ASMR cooking videos for hours!

## **3\. Methods to Find a Viral Titok Topic**

If you want your Tiktok video to go viral, you need to know what is getting viral currently. And for that, you’ll have to do some research.

**Tiktok Search Bar:** The best way to find a viral Tiktok topic is to visit the “Discover'' page on Tiktok. Here you’ll get to see all the trending hashtags and sounds.

![visit “discover” page on tiktok ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-complete-guide-for-tiktok-elements.png)

This also includes trending challenges. So, if you want to get noticed on Tiktok, use a viral sound or do a viral challenge!

## **4\. Best Examples for Tiktok Videos**

So, what kind of videos should you make to get to the top on Tiktok? Here are a few examples:

**Challenges:** One way to create a viral video is to go for social media challenges. People come up with challenge videos every now and then, and the whole world gets into the groove, like that ice bucket challenge from 2014 or the Cotton Eyed Joe challenge from 2021.

**Dance Videos:** Social media challenges are one thing, but viral dance videos take the fun to the next level. So, if you think you can dance, and add a bit of creativity to it, make a dance challenge video. If you’re good at it, you’ll definitely gain some followers.

**Lip Sync Videos:** Another way to go viral on Tiktok is to make lip-sync videos. The trick is to see who can do it without messing up the lyrics. Like this viral song “Already Best Friends” by Sagittarius Kween:

<https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKanPpe/>

**Art Videos:** If you can make art, you can go viral in no time! Take out those paints, colors, and pens, and create a time-lapse painting! Something like this:

<https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/>

**Satisfying ASMR Videos:** Satisfying ASMR videos are getting increasingly popular. And, by getting a decent noise-canceling mic, you can easily create such videos and increase your followers.

Like this kinetic sand ASMR video:

<https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmhDyT/>

**Makeup Videos:** Makeup tutorials are not only taking over Tiktok but they can be found on other social media platforms as well, with insane followers and subscribers! If you have the knack to create unique looks with makeup, try your hand at this!

These are just examples of the kind of videos that get viral on Tiktok. If you have skills similar to the videos mentioned above, or if you have any other skill for that matter, get on Tiktok, make a video, and get famous!

## **Tiktok Video Caption**

Once you have created an engaging Tiktok video, the next part is to write an attractive caption for it.

### **1\. Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions**

Here are some tips to help your videos go viral due to the captions:

**Quotes:** A caption can be any line that describes the video or a quote just to grab attention. You can use famous quotes or a dialogue that’s trending to make your caption attractive.

**Hashtags:** You can also use viral hashtags in your captions to make your video appear on the FYP or if someone searches for that particular hashtag. Another tip is to use generic hashtags alongside the viral ones, like #Art #Funny #Asmr, etc.

**Mentions:** Mentioning famous Tiktok accounts in your caption can also make people watch your video.

**Emojis:** Using emojis in the caption is a good idea to grab attention and make it worth reading.

We’re done with how to make watch-worthy Tiktok videos and add engaging captions. But did you know that the video cover also plays an essential role in getting more views?

## **Tiktok Video Cover**

Like influencers use catchy thumbnails for their YouTube videos; similarly, TikTok videos also have video covers. So, what should one do to make an attractive TikTok cover?

### **1\. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover**

A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not. Therefore, when choosing a cover for your video, make sure it:

* Accurately portrays the content
* Creates excitement among the audience
* Catches their attention

If you succeed in doing these 3 things, the audience will be definitely compelled to click on your video!

### **2\. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover**

If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:

**Include Text:** A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.

For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.

Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.

**Use a Good Font Style:** I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.

Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.

So, choose your font wisely!

**Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:** Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.

**Add Few Objects Only:** Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.

With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!

## **3\. Best Examples for TikTok Video Cover**

Here are some of the best examples of compelling TikTok video covers:

* If you’re looking for quick ways to earn some bucks, a TikTok video cover like this one is undoubtedly going to catch your eye and attention!

Once everything is on fleek, your TikTok video will definitely get more views. But, the key is to be consistent!

Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.

**Use a Good Font Style:** I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.

Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.

So, choose your font wisely!

**Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:** Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.

**Add Few Objects Only:** Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.

With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!

## **3\. Best Examples for TikTok Video Cover**

I have to admit the shortcuts of growing TikTok followers are really attractive. However, every coin has two sides. Have you ever thought about the engagement rate of your content if the followers are not real? In the long run, I suggest you could try other tips to skyrocket growth On TikTok. Just keep reading.

## How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?

Creating short music videos and posting them online, demands a lot of work because you have to select the song you're going to use, capture the footage perfectly and edit it before you can share a video on your TikTok profile. Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let's take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.

#### 1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers

This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok's most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.

#### 2. Make Your Profile Look Charming

![Charming Profile on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg)

Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn't going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you're producing fitness videos, it's also helpful if you mention that you're making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.

#### 3. Participate in Viral Challenges

Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.

#### 4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks

Don't limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won't be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn't much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.

#### 5. Don't Hesitate to Collaborate with Others

Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn't always pay off, especially if you're just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you're hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you're going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok's Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.

#### 6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos

All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don't have to use professional [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you'd like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from [User Gallery](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to empower video creation.

#### 7. Be Unique and Innovative

Find your own voice, because everyone else's voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you'll never find your own distinctive style. What's more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you're really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you're passionate about because if you're just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don't be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you'll discover something your fans adore, and you'll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.

#### 8. Keep Things Short and Concise

It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone's camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.

#### 9. You're Entertainer, Act Like One

![Entertainer on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg)

How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don't have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you're going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.

#### 10. Post New Content At Magic Hours

Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they're using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.

**Conclusion**

Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase.

I have to admit the shortcuts of growing TikTok followers are really attractive. However, every coin has two sides. Have you ever thought about the engagement rate of your content if the followers are not real? In the long run, I suggest you could try other tips to skyrocket growth On TikTok. Just keep reading.

## How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?

Creating short music videos and posting them online, demands a lot of work because you have to select the song you're going to use, capture the footage perfectly and edit it before you can share a video on your TikTok profile. Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let's take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.

#### 1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers

This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok's most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.

#### 2. Make Your Profile Look Charming

![Charming Profile on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg)

Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn't going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you're producing fitness videos, it's also helpful if you mention that you're making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.

#### 3. Participate in Viral Challenges

Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.

#### 4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks

Don't limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won't be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn't much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.

#### 5. Don't Hesitate to Collaborate with Others

Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn't always pay off, especially if you're just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you're hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you're going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok's Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.

#### 6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos

All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don't have to use professional [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you'd like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from [User Gallery](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to empower video creation.

#### 7. Be Unique and Innovative

Find your own voice, because everyone else's voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you'll never find your own distinctive style. What's more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you're really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you're passionate about because if you're just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don't be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you'll discover something your fans adore, and you'll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.

#### 8. Keep Things Short and Concise

It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone's camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.

#### 9. You're Entertainer, Act Like One

![Entertainer on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg)

How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don't have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you're going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.

#### 10. Post New Content At Magic Hours

Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they're using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.

**Conclusion**

Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase. Which strategies for growing followers do you use? Leave a comment and let us know.
