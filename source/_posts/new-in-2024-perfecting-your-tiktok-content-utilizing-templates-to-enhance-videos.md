## Perfecting Your TikTok Content: Utilizing Templates to Enhance Videos

TikTok is the video platform that shook the world during the pandemic. It capitalized on people's shortened attention spans and focused on short-form videos to provide entertainment. Also, it provided people with an easy road to fame and with a solid side hustle.

Are you one of those who aspire to be TikTok's future top-earner? Try making videos using **TikTok video templates**! They'll allow you to churn out high-quality content faster than the competition. In this article, you will learn more about TikTok videos. Furthermore, we'll introduce you to the 5 best places from where you can find great TikTok video templates.

Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos

TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for "bite-sized" content turn to this platform for entertainment.

The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.

An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.

## Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?

The competition on TikTok is tough. A content creator can publish multiple videos in one day because they're short, as long as they have ideas. So, attracting views with your videos is challenging.

If you can't keep up with how fast-paced other content creators are, you should ensure your videos are of high quality. But what if you run out of ideas?

That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.

Before proceeding further, it's essential to consider whether any copyright infringement issues could arise from downloading a TikTok video. According to the Community Guidelines of TikTok, users cannot post, send, or share any content that violates someone else's trademarks, copyrights, or intellectual property rights.

To prevent this, TikTok applies a watermark featuring both its account’s username and the logo that originally posted the content if someone downloads a TikTok video.

Cropping watermarks from your videos with Wondershare Filmora video editing software is a pretty straightforward process. You don't need be a professional to finish these simple editing actions.

All you must do is choose a method that best suits your preferences and performs an easy action, though.

So, without any delay, let's have a look at some editing techniques you can use to blur or crop watermarks from the downloaded videos of TikTok with Filmora.

If the downloaded video has more than one logo to hide, tapping the plus icon will introduce you to another mosaic square within the video

**Method 2: Remove watermark by Cropping the video**

This method will allow you to remove the watermark from your video entirely. Cropping the area where the watermark isn't possible in any video editor, so if you select to crop the video, be prepared to lose a particular section of the picture.

Right-click the video and choose the **Crop and Zoom** option once the footage you wish to crop is on the video track in Filmora's timeline.

![crop watermark filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-to-remove-watermark.jpg)

The crop window that enables you to use automatic aspect ratios or manually will appear on the screen. You can reposition the videos' corners of the cropping rectangle from here by dragging it as much as essential to remove TikTok's username watermark.
