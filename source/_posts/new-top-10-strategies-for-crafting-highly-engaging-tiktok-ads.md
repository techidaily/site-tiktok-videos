## Part 1: Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?

### 1\. The current generation dominates the entire platform

As the statement suggests, most TikTok users are teens and young adults. According to research, it is the largest population and has a considerable purchasing power of over $140 billion. Currently known as Generation Z, it also consists of the largest population in the United States and other countries in the world. These statistics imply that your business can grow when you invest in targeting this audience. Therefore, use TikTok Ads Manager to market your business here. As expected, you will collect more revenue from TikTok users.

### 2\. High engagement rate on TikTok

Surprisingly, TikTok has overtaken so many leading brands like Facebookregarding time spent by users. Over 70% of users in the United States and the UK spend more time on TikTok than Facebook. Advertising on TikTok always increases the engagement rate required for your business. Consequently, many companies have taken advantage of that and benefited more than they had on other platforms. Some startling facts?

Young adults' average time on Facebook is 58.5 minutes, while TikTok consumes 1 hour and 20 minutes of their time every day. Do you know what that means? More people will encounter your products and services on TikTok than on any social media platform. The more significant number of viewers leads to a larger market to get more clients.

### 3\. Advertising on TikTok gets your video to be viewed by many

A larger population retains more information obtained from videos than written information. About 93% of brands have gained many customers by using social media. Advertising your products on social media platforms allows you to reach a wider audience than other ways of communication. Most of the people are members of various social media groups. That translates to reaching a wider audience by using a single ad.

### 4\. The numerous ad formats for TikTok allow more significant engagements

TikTok comes with many TikTok advertising formats that will make you reach a wider audience. Whether they are making videos, watching the "For You" feeds, or whatever they are doing on TikTok, they will still come across your ads.

We have covered these types of advert formats below, so keep reading. If you have never used videos in marketing, give it a try and see miracles happen. Any marketing campaign that utilizes video is always powerful compared to text.

### 5.TikTok ads convey your products and services to an international audience

TikTok is currently available in 170 countries, and its expansion does not seem to slow down very soon. Moreover, it has many language subtitles amounting to 70\. Since most of these languages are international, there's no reason why you should be hesitating to access a global market. It doesn't matter whether your business is still getting on its feet. You will quickly get clients by serving them online. Slowly you will find your way out and end up surpassing the branded "marketing experts."

## Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?

We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.

**1\. In-Feed Ads**

![tiktok in feed ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg)

These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!

A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.

**2\. Brand Takeover ads**

These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the "For You" section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client's interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That's not just interesting. It's because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.

**3\. Top View ads**

![tiktok top view ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg)

These cover the first post in the "**Feeds**" section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience's attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That's where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.

**4\. Branded hashtags ads**

![tiktok hashtags ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg)

Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.

This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.

Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That's the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.

**5\. Branded effects ads**

![tiktok effects ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg)

Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.

03 [Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples?](#part3)

04 [How to Run Ads on TikTok?](#part4)

05 [Make Your TikTok Ads Attractive with Filmora](#part5)

## Part 1: Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?

### 1\. The current generation dominates the entire platform

As the statement suggests, most TikTok users are teens and young adults. According to research, it is the largest population and has a considerable purchasing power of over $140 billion. Currently known as Generation Z, it also consists of the largest population in the United States and other countries in the world. These statistics imply that your business can grow when you invest in targeting this audience. Therefore, use TikTok Ads Manager to market your business here. As expected, you will collect more revenue from TikTok users.

### 2\. High engagement rate on TikTok

Surprisingly, TikTok has overtaken so many leading brands like Facebookregarding time spent by users. Over 70% of users in the United States and the UK spend more time on TikTok than Facebook. Advertising on TikTok always increases the engagement rate required for your business. Consequently, many companies have taken advantage of that and benefited more than they had on other platforms. Some startling facts?

Young adults' average time on Facebook is 58.5 minutes, while TikTok consumes 1 hour and 20 minutes of their time every day. Do you know what that means? More people will encounter your products and services on TikTok than on any social media platform. The more significant number of viewers leads to a larger market to get more clients.

### 3\. Advertising on TikTok gets your video to be viewed by many

A larger population retains more information obtained from videos than written information. About 93% of brands have gained many customers by using social media. Advertising your products on social media platforms allows you to reach a wider audience than other ways of communication. Most of the people are members of various social media groups. That translates to reaching a wider audience by using a single ad.

### 4\. The numerous ad formats for TikTok allow more significant engagements

TikTok comes with many TikTok advertising formats that will make you reach a wider audience. Whether they are making videos, watching the "For You" feeds, or whatever they are doing on TikTok, they will still come across your ads.

We have covered these types of advert formats below, so keep reading. If you have never used videos in marketing, give it a try and see miracles happen. Any marketing campaign that utilizes video is always powerful compared to text.

### 5.TikTok ads convey your products and services to an international audience

TikTok is currently available in 170 countries, and its expansion does not seem to slow down very soon. Moreover, it has many language subtitles amounting to 70\. Since most of these languages are international, there's no reason why you should be hesitating to access a global market. It doesn't matter whether your business is still getting on its feet. You will quickly get clients by serving them online. Slowly you will find your way out and end up surpassing the branded "marketing experts."

## Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?

We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.

**1\. In-Feed Ads**

![tiktok in feed ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg)

These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!

A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.

**2\. Brand Takeover ads**

These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the "For You" section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client's interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That's not just interesting. It's because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.

**3\. Top View ads**

![tiktok top view ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg)

These cover the first post in the "**Feeds**" section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience's attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That's where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.

**4\. Branded hashtags ads**

![tiktok hashtags ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg)

Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.

This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.

Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That's the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.

**5\. Branded effects ads**

![tiktok effects ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg)

Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

TikTok is pretty awesome, the next big thing in social media, both for brands and individuals.

Luckily, the lip-sync and dance and app can be a lot more than that if your brand uses it with purpose in mind. And the first place to begin with that aim is in your TikTok bio.

Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.

It's because you don't want to consume time to introduce yourself in every video, again and again, so your **TikTok bios** provide you with the opportunity to do just that. This is your chance to describe to your followers who you are and why they should be your followers.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Here, we'll cover how to add a link to TikTok bio, 30+ TikTok bio ideas, and other fantastic tools to upgrade your TikTok profile.

* [Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps \[updated 2024\]](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?](#part2)
* [Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024](#part3)

## Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps \[updated 2024\]

Writing a TikTok bio doesn't have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let's dig deeper into those ultimate steps!

**Step 1: Describe your brand.**

![describe account tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg)

Source: blog.hubspot.com

Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn't rely on that.

What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.

It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account's purpose efficiently.

**Step 2: Add emojis.**

Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand's personality and showcase your brand's services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.

For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).

So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors' action.

**Step 3: Add a CTA.**

Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.

Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.

**Step 4: Don't exceed the character limit**.

TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That's just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.

**Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.**

TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it's currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we'll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok's bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.

So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.

Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.

## Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?

First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you'd like.

The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.

You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.

**Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok**

Yet, there is a caveat to the **TikTok bio** link option: not everyone can add a link to their **TikTok bio**. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:

**Step 1**: Hit the **"Edit your profile"** tab

**Step 2**: Check for the option "**Website**" underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.

There's no issue if you don't have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called **Testflight** through the app store.

Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page's upper right-hand corner to enter the "**Settings**" window. Then, scroll down and click **"Join TikTok Testers."**

![tiktok beta](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg)

Follow those instructions, and you'll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.

Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.

It's because you don't want to consume time to introduce yourself in every video, again and again, so your **TikTok bios** provide you with the opportunity to do just that. This is your chance to describe to your followers who you are and why they should be your followers.

## Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps \[updated 2024\]

Writing a TikTok bio doesn't have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let's dig deeper into those ultimate steps!

**Step 1: Describe your brand.**

![describe account tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg)

Source: blog.hubspot.com

Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn't rely on that.

What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.

It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account's purpose efficiently.

**Step 2: Add emojis.**

Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand's personality and showcase your brand's services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.

For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).

So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors' action.

**Step 3: Add a CTA.**

Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.

Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.

**Step 4: Don't exceed the character limit**.

TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That's just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.

**Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.**

TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it's currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we'll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok's bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.

So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.

Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.

## Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?

First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you'd like.

The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.

You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.

**Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok**

Yet, there is a caveat to the **TikTok bio** link option: not everyone can add a link to their **TikTok bio**. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:

**Step 1**: Hit the **"Edit your profile"** tab

**Step 2**: Check for the option "**Website**" underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.

There's no issue if you don't have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called **Testflight** through the app store.

Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page's upper right-hand corner to enter the "**Settings**" window. Then, scroll down and click **"Join TikTok Testers."**

![tiktok beta](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg)

Follow those instructions, and you'll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.

For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).

So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors' action.

**Step 3: Add a CTA.**

Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.

Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.

**Step 4: Don't exceed the character limit**.

TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That's just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.

**Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.**

TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it's currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we'll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok's bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.

So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.

Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.

## Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?

First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you'd like.

The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.

You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.

**Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok**

Yet, there is a caveat to the **TikTok bio** link option: not everyone can add a link to their **TikTok bio**. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:

**Step 1**: Hit the **"Edit your profile"** tab

**Step 2**: Check for the option "**Website**" underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.

There's no issue if you don't have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called **Testflight** through the app store.

Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page's upper right-hand corner to enter the "**Settings**" window. Then, scroll down and click **"Join TikTok Testers."**

![tiktok beta](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg)

Follow those instructions, and you'll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.
