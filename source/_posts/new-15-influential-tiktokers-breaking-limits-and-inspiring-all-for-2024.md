## Part 2: How to Become Famous on TikTok?

Before being declared an influencer on TikTok, you must have many views, followers, and likes. But how exactly can you do that? Well, don't miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.

### 1. Take a video with a trending song or audio

First, you have to know what's trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don't have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, "The Whoa" track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.

### 2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags

Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.

Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don't forget to include some that depict your post's content to avoid making it too irrelevant.

### 3. Maintain your theme

Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don't keep on mixing themes.

### 4. Don't ever settle on the quality of the video

Before being declared an influencer on TikTok, you must have many views, followers, and likes. But how exactly can you do that? Well, don't miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.

### 1. Take a video with a trending song or audio

First, you have to know what's trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don't have to worry about your voice getting noticed.

Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know.

For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.

Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don't forget to include some that depict your post's content to avoid making it too irrelevant.

### 3. Maintain your theme

Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don't keep on mixing themes.

Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and parmesan cheese. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy. Risotto in Italy is normally a primo (first course), served on its own before the main course.

## Japanese Food on TikTok

Japanese food is having a moment all over TikTok. The app's viral power has turned dishes like donburi (rice bowls), okonomiyaki (savory pancakes), and ramen noodles into must-try Japanese cuisines for home cooks worldwide.

The appeal of the Japanese food trend on TikTok is twofold. Firstly, it offers a way to explore different flavors and textures that may not be totally familiar. Secondly, when it comes to cooking Japanese food at home, many of the videos offer an important shortcut: they help you find easy alternatives to ingredients that are hard to come by.

Som popular Japanese food TikTok include:

### ● Sushi

Sushi is perhaps the most popular Japanese dish outside of Japan. It consists of cooked vinegared rice combined with other ingredients, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It’s mostly served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.

Sushi comes in many types, which include nigiri-zushi (oval-shaped rice topped with a slice of raw fish or seafood). Gunkan-maki is another type of sushi that is seaweed filled with rice and fish roe or other ingredients such as sea urchin roe or oysters.

### ● Hiyashi Chuka

Hiyashi chuka is a cold version of ramen, served with a mix of thinly sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, ham, and eggs. It's normally served during the summer months only.

### ● Shabu Shabu

Shabu shabu is a hot pot dish in which very thinly sliced beef and vegetables are cooked in water or broth and eaten with a dipping sauce. At the table, diners dip their meat and vegetables into the broth to cook them before eating.

### ● Kaiseki

Kaiseki meal is a multi-course meal that combines traditional Japanese aesthetics with seasonal ingredients. The dishes are usually smaller and more intricate than other dishes, making kaiseki one of the most beautiful cuisines in the world.

### ● Yakitori

Yakitori refers to chicken grilled on a skewer and seasoned with salt or tare sauce (a mix of soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar). They can be made from all different parts of the chicken, including breast, thigh, skin and cartilage among other things.

## TikTok African Food

African cuisine is a delight, and TikTok is making it more popular. African food is slowly becoming a trend on TikTok.

![“TikTok African Food](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/popular-food-recipes-5.png)

The continent of Africa is so big that it's hard to generalize about its cuisine, or even to group its cuisines into categories. Even within individual countries or regions, you will find an astonishing variety of foods and flavors.

But there are some common themes that run through most African cuisines:

A preference for starchy staples – such as rice, yams, millet, sorghum, and maize (corn) – paired with sauces made from local ingredients such as tomatoes, leafy greens, peppers, and beans.

### ● Jollof rice

Nigerian jollof rice is one of the country's most popular dishes, and it's become a staple on TikTok. Jollof rice is a rice dish made with tomatoes, green peppers, onion, and spices like ginger, garlic, paprika, and black pepper.

It can be served as a side dish or as a meal with additional ingredients. Some users have added sausages and fried plantains to their jollof rice before serving.

### ● Suya

It’s another popular African food called TikTok. Suya is a snack that can be found all over Nigeria and West Africa. It consists of skewers of meat covered in peanut butter and spices like ginger powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, vegetable oil, and bouillon cubes. The meat can be made from any cut of beef or chicken but traditionally uses beef steak or chicken thigh filet.

### ● Fufu

Fufu is a soft white dough made from cassava or yams flour (also known as cassava flour). It may also be made from plantain or cocoyam. Fufu is normally eaten with stews and soups like Peanut Soup in Ghana, Egusi Soup in Nigeria, etc.

### ● Braai

Braai comes from South Africa's BBQ tradition and is an important part of social gatherings in South Africa. There are several kinds of meat cooked on a grill such as steak, chicken, pork chops, sausages, etc.

## Conclusion

After a long, hard day of work, you simply can’t imagine what to eat. Doesn’t matter if you are exhausted, stressed out, or even in a bad mood; food is the magic elixir that can make your day or spoil it completely.

Eating a tasty meal is one way to relieve stress and refresh yourself. If you need some inspiration for your next cuisine from another country, you will find this collection of popular foods on TikTok very helpful.
