**Record Voiceover and Add it to Video**

We suggest you record the voiceover first in most cases so the sound will become pretty natural.

**Step 1: Connect Microphone to PC or laptop**

Connect the microphone to your laptop/PC when you're ready to begin. It's advisable to use some professional external microphones to capture high-quality sound.

**Step 2: Record voiceover**

Tap the **Wondershare Filmora** icon to launch this software. Then, select the New **Project** option in the beginning interface to create a new one.

Enter the **Record** tab and choose the "**Record a Voiceover”** option to arouse the **Record Audio** windows.

Or hit the **microphone** icon, and you only need 3 seconds of countdown to begin speaking.

Click the microphone icon again after you finish the above. Then, a new **Record** file option will be automatically present on the audio track.

**Step 3: Edit Recorded Voiceover to Video**

To edit the recorded voiceover, you can adjust audio settings, such as changing the Speed, Pitch, Volume, etc.

![edit voiceover filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg)

You can cut and trim out unnecessary sound sections from the recorded voiceover or apply the fade effects to the voiceover for a smoother transition.

**Step 4: Sync Voiceover to Video**

Now, it’s time to synchronize the recorded voiceover to video to create a compelling video.

The Wondershare Filmora allows up to 100 audio tracks; you can also add some background music to the voiceover.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video content to the video track, drag and drop the soundtrack to the video's right-side position. Keep the voice and video track in the exact video duration if required.

**Here’s how to sync voiceover to video!**

Now, sync the recorded voiceover to Video to create a video. Since Filmora is compatible with 100 plus audio tracks, you can add different background music to the voiceover.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video content to the video track, drag and drop the soundtrack to the Video's right side position. You can keep the Video and audio track in the same video duration.

![sync voiceover filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-recorded-voiceover-to-video.jpg)
