## Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Mac OS

TikTok users like you flock to the app due to its entertainment value, global reach, and ease of use. When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.

The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.

1. You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.

2. Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.

3. Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.

4. After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.

5. Once the video is uploaded, you will be asked to put in a caption. We advise you to keep the caption quirky and fun. Another quick tip is that you should use hashtags that are trending at the moment as that will increase the visual appearance of your video more.

6. Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.

 ![Upload tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Upload-tiktok-video.jpg)

7. Lastly, choose the audience of the video according to your preference in the same window.

## Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows

As a person who does not own a Mac, you might be wondering if this article is for you or not. From this point onwards, the method will be for people who have a PC. To upload a video to TikTok from a PC, you can follow the same steps as above.

Believe it or not, the simplest way to upload videos to TikTok on Windows is the one that we have described in detail above. Of course, you will need to remember to edit the videos beforehand with the assistance of Tiktok video editing software.

If you wish to up your game and follow the best method and not the simplest one then we have something for you. The answer for many TikTok users is an android emulator. It is a sort of an application that behaves like an android device on your PC. It can be downloaded directly on Windows and used from your computer.

The benefit is that it will allow you to use the application version of TikTok which will allow you to edit the video just like you do on your smartphone.

## Funnies Frontier: Emerging Comedy Sensations on TikTok

As with all social media websites, Tiktok was also introduced for the purpose of entertainment. Although it has become a platform for much more than enjoyment, its main purpose still serves to be joy.

Tiktok trends and funny videos have gone through the roof in recent years. People from all around the world pick up any topic, splash some humor on it and post it for the rest of the world to see.

In this article, we will list the top Tiktok comedy trends and stars you must follow!

## Tiktok Comedy Trends

Tiktok videos have a way of becoming trends pretty easily. Users tend to add sass and humor to anything and everything and turn it into a trend. Then everyone gets onto the bandwagon, and we see our FYP flooding with different versions of the same trend.

Over the years, we have seen many Tiktok comedy trends that have made us laugh our hearts out. Let’s take a look at some of the best ones.

### 1\. Poking Fun at Life Hacks

This trend started out with Khaby Lame, who posted a video during the pandemic where he poked fun at a life hack video. Eventually, many people caught on and started making videos where they would try absurd hacks, which never worked.

### 2\. Zoom Meeting Mishaps

Zoom meeting mishaps are one of the most hilarious trends that took TikTok by storm. In the initial pandemic phase, people were getting accustomed to the online world where using zoom was a big challenge for a lot of us.
