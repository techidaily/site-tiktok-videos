The video will automatically start playing and you can just tap on the **Share icon** in the lower right section of the screen and proceed to select the **Download option** from the new window that contains different share options.

The download will start immediately after you tap on the **Download icon**, and the video will be saved to your phone's camera roll.

## Method 2: Using the Video Downloader Apps to Download other TikTok Videos

The process of downloading videos to a Smartphone directly from the TikTok app can be quite slow, so if you want to save videos from this video sharing platform to your phone in no time you can try using some of the downloader apps for Musical.ly that are available at the Google Play store.

### Downloading TikTok Videos With the Video Downloader for Musical.ly

Once you've installed the [Video Downloader for Musical.ly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avalon.musically.downloader) on your phone, you should open the TikTok app and locate the video you want to save.

All of your videos are available on the profile page, so you should tap on the **Account icon** and proceed to select the video you'd like to download. Tap on the **Share icon** once the video starts playing, and then tap on the **Copy Link** option.

Launch the Video Downloader for Musical.ly app and paste the link to the designated destination in the app. The preview of your video will appear on the screen, and you'll be able to choose between **Save Image** and **Download Video** options.

Tap on the **Download Video** option and wait for the download process to be completed. You won't have to wait long, as the app downloads videos faster than the TikTok app.

### Downloading Videos From TikTok Using the Downloader for Musical.ly app

The process of downloading videos from TikTok with [Downloader for Musical.ly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.galaxyapps.musicallysave) is identical to the process of downloading videos with Video Downloader for Musical.ly app.

You just have to copy the link of the video in the TikTok app, paste it to the Downloader for Musical.ly app and hit **Download**.

However, the app contains adds which can be a bit frustrating if you're planning on using it on a daily basis.

Once you select the video you want to send you should simply click on the **Share icon**, select the email option from the menu and insert the email addresses into the **To and From** sections.

You can also send TikTok videos to yourself by inserting your own email address into both sections.

Go to your email account where you will be able to see the video you sent to yourself or to your friend. The **Download option** will be displayed next to the video, so just click on it in order to save the video to your phone.

## Method 4: Saving MP4 Video Files to a PC

The web-based version of the TikTok platform called [Musical.ly Videos](https://musicallyvideos.com/) enables its users to browse through thousands of videos from their computers.

However, the download option is not available, so in order to save MP4 video files to a PC computer, you must first install the [5KPlayer](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/) that lets you download videos from all video sharing platforms.

Afterwards, you should just **copy the video's URL** and paste it into the 5KPlayer. You can do this by clicking on the **Paste URL & Analyze button** in the 5KPlayer.

Once the thumbnail of the video is displayed you can just click on the **Download button** to save the MP4 video file to the desired location on your hard drive.
