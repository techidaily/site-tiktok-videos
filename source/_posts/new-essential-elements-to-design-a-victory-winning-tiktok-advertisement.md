## What Is Tiktok Reaction Video

Reaction videos are exactly what they sound like — a video of someone reacting to something. Reaction videos have been around since the early days of YouTube when people would upload their reactions to music, movies, and TV shows. But with the launch of TikTok in 2017, reaction videos exploded in popularity. They are one of the most popular video types on social media platforms.

Reaction videos are a type of video where people record their reactions to other content as it unfolds before them. Reaction videos are popular on TikTok because they elicit an emotional response from the viewer. The most common emotions are joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear, and anger. It's easy to see why these videos are so popular — they're fun!

## Why Are TikTok Videos So Popular?

The popularity of TikTok reaction videos is easy to understand. It is fun to watch people react to something they're seeing for the very first time. In addition, these types of videos are entertaining and silly. They are typically not too serious or dramatic in tone.

Reaction videos allow you to laugh at yourself or laugh with someone else who has been through something similar (or even worse). If someone else has gone through it before, the chances are that they've learned from their mistakes too! This could be an important lesson for you as well!
