Before proceeding further, it's essential to consider whether any copyright infringement issues could arise from downloading a TikTok video. According to the Community Guidelines of TikTok, users cannot post, send, or share any content that violates someone else's trademarks, copyrights, or intellectual property rights.

To prevent this, TikTok applies a watermark featuring both its account’s username and the logo that originally posted the content if someone downloads a TikTok video.
