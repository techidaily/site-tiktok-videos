* Save TikTok video to any device like PC, android, iOS, or tablet.
* Save it in any format, MP3, or MP4.
* Choose to remove the watermark.
* There's no need to download the app. Only the video's URL is needed.
* No registration or installation of the downloader is needed.
* The platform offers free and unlimited downloads.

I'm sure this is enough to convince you but wait till you see how easy it is to use. Follow these steps and see for yourself what the fuss is all about. Here you go:

1\. Open 'www.ttdownloader.com' in the browser.

![open online video downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-open-online-tiktok-downloader.jpg)

2\. Right-click on the TikTok video and tap 'Copy link address.'

![copy video link ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-copy-tiktok-video-link.jpg)

3\. Paste the URL into the textbox on TTDownloader. And hit 'Get Video.' A drop-down menu will appear with different options.

4\. Choose the way you want to download your video and click on the 'Download video.' The video will be saved to your gallery within seconds. Easy peasy.

## Method 3: Save TikTok Video by a Third-Party App

TikMate is a TikTok video downloading app available on the Google store. It offers super-fast downloading and is free. You can download unlimited videos, and it doesn't even require logging in. I know that can be tiring and instantly makes you hate the app. With that settled, let me add that it is not just a downloader, but also a video player! How cool. And all the downloaded videos are in the app, so you don't have to search your gallery looking for it.

Some apps have complicated interfaces, but TikMate once again wins us over with its simplicity. Only a few quick steps, and you'll have your favorite video saved.

1\. Download TikMate from the Google store and launch it.

2\. Open TikTok and tap the video you wish to save. Now you can click 'Share,' swipe left, and click 'Others,' and select to open the video with TikMate.

![click share video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-click-share-video.jpg)

**Note:** You can also click 'Share', then hit 'Copy link', and open Tikmate to paste the link.

3\. Paste the copied URL OR if it appears automatically after direct sharing to TikMate, click 'Download'.

4\. The video will start downloading and will end up in your gallery as well as in the TikMate library.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The newest editing options to make your TikTok videos stand out include:

* **Motion Tracking:** Now, you can add a Hollywood-style effect to your video with the simple motion tracking feature by Filmora. The motion tracking icon is now right above the timeline. Just select an object or person to track and click the icon. As easy as that. Track an athlete on the race track or follow a ship in its journey.
* **Audio Ducking:** Fade or lower the background audio so that the dialogue you want to focus on stands out. Audio ducking introduces a dramatic effect to your video. Using this feature also ensures a professional outlook. The technique might seem sophisticated but is actually a one-click process. Just select the clip you want to audio-focus and click **Adjust Audio**.
* **Keyframing:** Now, you can animate your videos by using pre-sets. If you want to customize your animations, you can do it in just a few taps. Rotate, zoom, or change the position of the video in any way you like.
* **Color Matching:** One of the most important editing features. One-click color match allows you to copy color from one video to another. This feature will give your clips a consistent look. You can even save a color-corrected template for further use.
* **Dark/Light Interface:** It doesn't matter what time of the day (or night) it is. Select the model that suits you.
