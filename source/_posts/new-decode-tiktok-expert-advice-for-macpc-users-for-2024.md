## How to Install TikTok on a PC Computer?

Before you start recording music videos with TikTok on desktops, you have to install the [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) emulator first.

Once the installer launches, click on the **Install Now** button. After the installation is completed, click on the **Complete** button.

Now the BlueStacks emulator is installed on your PC. Launch it and head over to the **App Center** tab. You will be asked to sign in to your Google account. And if you don't have one, you need to create a Google account for using TikTok or any other Android app from your computer.

You can type TikTok into the **Search Bar** that is located in the upper right corner of the emulator's window in order to find the TikTok app on Google Play. Once the app appears in the search results, click on it and proceed to click on the **Install** button. Click **Accept** in the pop-up window to give the app access to the computer's camera.

## FAQs

### Q1\. What is an Emulator?

In computing, emulator is a software or hardware that makes your computer system act like another system.

Likewise, having an Android emulator on your desktop or laptop will enable you to download and run mobile applications on your system.

### Q2\. What is BlueStacks, and why is it famous?

BlueStacks is a free and famous emulator for running Android applications on Windows and macOS. And it is totally legal to download and run BlueStacks on your system, as the company is partnered with some industry-leading organizations, such as Intel, Samsung, and AMD.

### Q3\. Why is BlueStacks so slow?

There could be a few reasons for slow BlueStacks on your computer. However, the most authentic one is outdated software. So, if you are using an older version of BlueStacks, go to the website and download the latest version.

You can do a couple of things to stop your BlueStacks from lagging. First, turn on the “Virtualization.” Second, ensure you have allocated your CPU cores and RAM details in BlueStacks settings.
