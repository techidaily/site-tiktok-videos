Every rising pop star needs music videos, but using professional video editing software may be too time-consuming if you want to quickly create a clone video you can share with your fans on TikTok.

Multiplying yourself in a video is a cool way of making sure that your video is going to get the kind of attention it deserves. The process of [cloning yourself in a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a simple one, but there are certain rules you have to follow while recording the footage that will help you avoid overlapping the figures you're cloning. Here's how you can make your first **clone yourself video on TikTok**.

## Selecting the Song for your Clone Video

Before you start shooting the video you first need to select the song on [TikTok](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id835599320?mt=8)you're going to use in the video. Once you've found the perfect track simply record it and save it as a video to your camera roll. You can then import the video clip that contains the song into the [Video Star](http://videostarapp.com/) app.

Here are [10 Popular TikTok Songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you.

## Using the Video Star App to Clone Yourself

#### 1\. Download Video Star App

Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you'll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don't have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone's native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.

#### 2\. Edit Multiple Video Clips

After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone's native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn't overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.

#### 3\. Level up Your Videos with Video Star

Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you'll be recording like TikTok does on fast.

Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone's location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.

To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you're not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.

When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn't come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video's shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.

Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don't want to use.

The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you've edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.

### Conclusion

Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time. The Video Star app lets you create as many clones of yourself as you want, so you just have to make sure that your video clips can be easily combined to feature two or more of your clones and have fun exploring the effects that can make your videos look even cooler. If you want to be a success on the TikTok platform, learning how to make clone videos is one of the best ways to do it, so choose your favorite songs and start producing clone yourself videos.

## Rapid Progression in TikTok Videos

When we state that TikTok is a gift, we know that we speak for many, if not all. Undoubtedly, it made the summer of 2020 much more bearable, and today it has become a leader in entertainment for the rest of the globe. The software has had a profound impact on many people's daily lives.

Only a few factors hold TikTok back from becoming the finest among the best. One of the drawbacks is that it doesn't allow you to pause or fast-forward. There are instances when you would like to go back and review a particular video from a TikTok and wouldn't want to have to watch the entire thing again to see it. So far, it appears like that's the case. Or is it? We have come here with the answers to all of your questions in this **'How to Fast Forward on TikTok'** guide. Let's explore!

#### In this article

01 [How to Fast Forward on Tiktok When Playing?](#part1)

02 [How to Record Fast Motion Video on TikTok on iPhone and Android?](#part2)

03 [How to Add Fast Motion Effect to Uploaded Video on TikTok?](#part3)

04 [How to Download A TikTok Video to Fast Forward on iPhone and Android?](#part4)

05 [How to Fast Forward Videos in TikTok on a PC?](#part5)

## Part 1: How to Fast Forward on Tiktok When Playing?

TikTok videos include a progress bar, which allows you to jump between them; nevertheless, this feature is not accessible for all videos. For the time being, the function is only visible on lengthier films.

Although it is unlikely, it is also possible to download a TikTok clip and then fast forward or rewind it at your convenience without using the TikTok app. But how to do it is the real question here. Follow the steps below to learn the trick:

**Step 1:** Find a **white progress bar** at the bottom of the clip on TikTok by opening the app and selecting it.

![tiktok video playback white progress bar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-playback-white-progress-bar.jpg)

**Step 2:** The dot on the progress bar that appears like a white line may be moved forward or backward by tapping and dragging it along the bar. Note that the revised location will be reflected above the bar in the first timecode number.

![fast forward tiktok video playing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fast-forward-tiktok-video-playing.jpg)

**Step 3**: Using your finger, touch on the **White circle** and move it forward or backward to the place indicated by the timecode figure displayed above it.

**Step 4:** When you **let go of the dot**, you would have shifted your position in the clip.

## Part 2: How to Record Fast Motion Video on TikTok on iPhone and Android?

A rapid-motion movie must be recorded with an increased speed between each frame to get a faster playback speed. Videos that move at a high rate of speed have a hypnotic impact on viewers. The procedures of creating a fast-motion video in TikTok for Android are outlined in the following section.

### **Record fast motion video on TikTok Android**

**Step 1:** After launching the app, the feed area will appear. It would help if you touched on the **"+"** option in the feed area to get to the "**Add new**" section.

**Step 2:** Speed control must be enabled when adding a new option. To change the speed, use the **speed control** option in the upper right corner of the screen.

![tiktok speed option icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-speed-option-icon.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step is to decide on the video's frame rate. The rectangular bar lets you choose a speed. Tap on the chosen speed from here.

![record tiktok fast forward options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tiktok-fast-forward-options.jpg)

**Step 4:** You may begin recording your video after selecting the **required frame rate**. You may accomplish this by holding down the red circular **recording** option as indicated in the image below while tapping and holding.

## Part 5: How to Fast Forward Videos in TikTok on a PC?

Following its meteoric increase in popularity, most users expressed a desire to utilize it on their PC to connect with friends and explore new musical and video compositions by like-minded individuals. This is why TikTok made significant improvements in its PC version. The majority of the features formerly restricted to mobile applications can now be accessed using a web browser.

Even though certain features are still restricted for PC TikTok, there is little need to utilize additional features to get the most out of your TikTok use. In addition, you can simply fast forward and rewind video recordings on a computer with relative ease. To learn more, just follow these easy steps:

**Step 1:** Log in to your TikTok account by going to the TikTok website on your PC.

**Step 2:** Once you're on the home page, click on any video that you may wish to view.

**Step 3:** Once the video opens, you will see a progress meter at the bottom of the video. The bar continues to thicken throughout the video. A white dot will emerge if you hold your cursor above the bar. Now, you can conveniently fast forward and rewind any video just by moving the white dot forward or backward.
