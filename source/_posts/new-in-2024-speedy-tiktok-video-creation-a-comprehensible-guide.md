Dixie’s fame goes in sync with her sister Charli’s as they appear in many of each other’s videos. With earnings of $2.9 million, she is among the top three on the list. The D’Amelios signed joint deals with many companies and Dixie is striking out on her own with her music career.

### 4.Loren Gray

Thanks to her immense popularity on TikTok, Loren Gray made a casual $2.4 million. In addition to the usual sponsored content and endorsement deals, she has turned her online success into a full-blown music career.

### 5.Josh Richards

According to Forbes, Josh is worth $1.5 million – and it’s not just because of sponsorship deals with major brands. He earns income from his merch line and his own drink business too. Also, he has co-founded his own talent management company.

### Conclusion

Doing what you are passionate about is one thing; making money from it is another. That is what the TikTok creator fund does for video content creators. So, if you trust your creativity, joining the creator fund program might be a lifetime opportunity for you. Maintain a robust content strategy and start earning money through your own content on TikTok!
