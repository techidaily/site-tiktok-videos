## Part 1: What Does PFP for TikTok Mean?

PFP is an acronym for Profile Picture. It is an obvious one. Previously, profile picture was simply known as PP but TikTok users use the acronym PFP. On other social media platforms, the acronym stands for Picture for Proof. Thus, it basically is asking a user to send proof of what they are doing. Nonetheless, they are primarily associated with IM and Snapchat apps.

As TikTok is a video-sharing platform, PFP just stands for the profile picture.
