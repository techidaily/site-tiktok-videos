## Part 3: Tips to Run an Excellent TikTok Ad Campaign

To successfully launch your first TikTok campaign, check out these five tips!

**1\. Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events**

TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website's header.

Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.

**2\. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them**

Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs. After that, develop lookalikes of those audiences.

The similar will come in handy when you're making target audiences for such campaigns, and you'll be able to eliminate some of your groups of ads to allow better waste management.

**3\. Create Target Audiences that Aren't Too Small**

There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That's a considerable number, though!

On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.

**4\. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind**

You're interrupting someone's feed with a brand ad that the user didn't ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.

**5\. Use Excellent Tool to Create Ads**
