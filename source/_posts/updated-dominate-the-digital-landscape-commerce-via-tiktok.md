![spinxo tiktok name generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spinxo-name-generator.jpg)

Spinxo is another username generator with a variety of name-generating options. It has different tabs called **Name or Nickname**, **What are you like**, **Hobbies**, **Things You Like**, **Important Words**, **Numbers or Letters**, etc.

After entering all these ideas in your mind, tap the **Spin** button and get many **TikTok username** **ideas** again.

### 3. [Business Name Generator](https://businessnamegenerator.com/username-generator/)

Our last pick is quite a simple username generator where you need to enter a keyword or an idea and hit the **Generate** button. However, the best part is that you can quickly check the domain availability on GoDaddy by toggling the option given beneath the tab.

So, that's the USP of this generator!
