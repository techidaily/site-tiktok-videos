## The 2023 Roadmap for Dominant Desktop TikTok Videos

With the increasing trend of using Tiktok to make viral videos, every other person out there is trying their hand at this video-sharing platform.

It becomes difficult to go all out with your videos with these limitations. Therefore, a third-party or external video editor is necessary to make better and different videos.

In this article, we will go over different ways how to create successful Tiktok videos on Desktop, Android, and iPhone.

**Step 4**

Once you have edited the Tiktok video to your heart’s content, you can preview it to see if any further changes are required. After that, you can export it to your Android or iOS device to upload directly from the Tiktok app.

![export the tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/9-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

And that’s how you edit a Tiktok video on a desktop.

Now, if you want to create successful Tiktok videos right from the palm of your hands, here is a tutorial for both Android and iPhone.

## **Create Successful Tiktok Videos on Android/iPhone**

The steps to create an engaging Tiktok video using Android or iPhone are almost the same. So, follow the steps below to edit and record a Tiktok video on both devices:

**Step 1**

Download the Tiktok app from the Play Store for Android and App Store for iPhone.

![download the “tiktok” app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/10-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 2**

Launch the app and sign up using your phone number, Facebook or Gmail. If you already have an account, click on “Sign in” and enter the details.

![login to the “tiktok”](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/11-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 3**

![tap on the “ + ” sign](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/12-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 4**

Tap on “Add Sound” to add audio to your video. This will open a gallery of sounds available on Tiktok. Additionally, you can also click on “My Sound” to add audio from your device.

![add sound to the video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/13-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

![click on “my sound” to add audio of your choice](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/14-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 5**

You can select the duration of your video by tapping on the 3 timer options.

![set the duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/15-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 6**

To add effects to your video, tap on “Effects” to open a gallery of built-in Tiktok effects. Select the effect you want to use.

![tap on “effects” ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/16-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

![add “effects” in the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/17-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 7**

Now click on the round red button to start recording. Once you have recorded your video, you can edit it. Like, by clicking on the “Speed” option, you can set the speed of your video.

![set the speed of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/18-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

Similarly, by tapping on “Filters,” you can add different filters to your recorded video.

![tap on “filters” ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/19-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

![add “filters” in the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/20-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

And, to fix any blemishes on your face or to smoothen the skin, you can tap on “Beautify” and do the magic!

![tap on “beautify” ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/21-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

![fix the blemishes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/22-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 8**

Done with all the edits? Tap the red “tick” option to proceed to the next part, where you can add text, stickers, voice effects, and adjust the clips. Click “Next” to move on to posting the video.

![tap on “red tick” button ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/23-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

![tap on “next” button to post he video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/24-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 9**

Before posting the video on Tiktok, you can add a description, hashtags, and tag friends in it. You can also adjust the settings of who can watch your video, who can comment, and if people can make duets.

Once all the settings have been finalized, click on “Post” to post the video to Tiktok.

![tap on “post” option to upload the video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/25-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

And that’s how you create, edit, and post a Tiktok video on Android and iOS devices.

## **Conclusion**

Tiktok videos are not only about following the trends; in fact, you can use them to create brand awareness, market your product or services, or engage with your audience in an effective way. However, the key is to make a video worth watching! And while Tiktok’s built-in editor has many tools, it comes with certain limitations.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

**Step 2**

Launch the tool, and click on the “+” sign to import the Tiktok video you want to edit.

![to import the video for editing, click on the “ + ” sign.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 3**

Once your video clip is successfully imported to the timeline, it’s time to get editing! Filmora offers many basic and advanced editing tools to give a professional touch to your Tiktok videos.

For example, you can:

* Add audio to your videos from a vast library of tracks for all occasions.

![add “audio” to the video from software’s library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)
