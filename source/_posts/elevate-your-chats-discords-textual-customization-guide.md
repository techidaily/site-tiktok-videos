Discord is a brand name that many people have heard about, and this instant messaging and content distribution service is rapidly gaining popularity among many groups of users. A unique feature of this platform is that it facilitates community-based communication, where users who share certain interests can form their own private chats that are known as servers.

While its user interface is quite simple, Discord allows users to deploy a variety of advanced communication tools, from textual content to audio and video streams. It’s natural that users want to express their thoughts creatively, so there is a lot of genuine interest in learning how to change the visual look of the messages through the use of basic text formatting. In this article, we will discuss how to change text style in Discord and provide detailed instructions for activating various options, such as using bold or italic letters or underlining a part of the text.

Let’s start with the software module that makes it all possible.

## Part 1: How Does Discord Text Engine Work?

Beneath the surface, Discord runs on a powerful engine called Markdown, which regulates how text is displayed on the pages visible to users. It’s an application of markup language that completely depends on textual symbols as commands, making it quite simple for users who are not skilled at advanced programming to alter the look of the text.

Basically, Markdown allows you to enter a few symbols and it will interpret them as commands for changing the text style, for example bolding or underlying certain word or sentence. For highlighting blocks of text, there is a specific library named [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) that allows simple text marking for stylistic emphasis.

This approach is very practical and easy to learn, so long-time users of Discord are able to change text style as they type without thinking too much about it. Really, it’s all about following a couple of simple rules and knowing the most important combinations of characters (tags).

## Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?

As we mentioned previously, Markdown is completely text-based and has a very simple syntax. All you need to do to apply special formatting to your text is to enter a few special characters at the right places, and the appropriate effect (bold, italic…) will appear in the chat. Keep in mind that you can easily combine the formatting styles by using multiple commands at the same time.

Here is an overview of the most important options for changing text style in Discord, and you can preview the text style in real time before sending to friends:

![Change Text Style in Discord  - Basic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-text-style.jpg)

#### **How to Bold Text in Discord?**

A simple way to use bold text style is to add two asterisks (\*\*) at the beginning and the end of the text that you want to have this effect.

#### **How to Italicize in Discord?**

Italicized style of text will be displayed in the chat if you put one asterisk character (\*) before and one more after the selected text.

#### **How to Write Strikethrough and Make Discord Cross Out Text?**

In order to get a strikethrough effect on your text, you will have to type two tilde characters (\~\~) on either side of the section of text that you want to change, and then you will create an appearance of a crossed-out portion of text.

#### **How to Make Discord Underline Text?**

Underline effect is also available on Discord and equally simple to activate. Just type two underscore dashes (\_\_)at the start and the ending of the text selection to apply it.

### How to Combine Text Formatting Options in Discord?

Once you mastered the basic effects and know the commands without thinking, it’s time to consider more complex text transformations that combine more than one effect. In principle, Markdown lets you do this just as easily, for as long as you know all the right combinations of characters that produce the desired effect. Here are the detailed instructions for some of the most frequently utilized combos:

#### Underlined and Italicized text

For this elegant combination, use two underscore dashes (\_\_) followed by one asterisk (\*) before and after the selected text.

![Discord Underlined and Italicized text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-text.jpg)

#### Underlined and Bolded text

Put two underscore dashes (\_\_) and add two asterisk characters (\*\*) to both sides of the selection to get those two effects together.

![Discord Underlined and Bolded text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Underlined, Italicized, and Bolded text

This combination is achieved by placing two underscore marks (\_\_) and three straight asterisks (\*\*\*) at the beginning as well as the end of the text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded  text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Bolded, Italicized, underlined, and crossed out text

You can combine all four style changes as well – just use two tildes (\~\~), two underscores (\_\_) and three asterisks (\*\*\*) on either side of your text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded crossed out text ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-cross-out-text.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?

In addition to simple font transformations, Discord allows users to engage in advanced text formatting with incredible ease. One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( \` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( \` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.

## Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?

It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.

To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.

Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.

## FAQs About Discord Text Formatting

#### 1\. What is the default Discord font?

Discord uses the same basic font all over the entire platform, including all chats between users and in your profile info. This is Uni sans font, which is quite simple and belongs to the sans serif family of fonts that are known for good readability on almost any background.

#### 2\. How do you get different fonts on Discord?

It’s not possible to change the font directly from the Discord app, but this limitation can be circumvented if you find a good[Discord font generator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the internet. Those are very easy to use, so you can simply type your text in a chosen font and copy it back into Discord already formatted.

#### 3\. How to make a hidden text in Discord?

The creation of a hidden text message that requires direct user action to reveal is possible in Discord and requires a so-called spoiler tag. If you precede your message with the text /spoiler or type two slash bars ( //) at either side, it will be hidden from other users except for those who decide to view it and indicate their desire by clicking or tapping on it. Messages of this kind appear highlighted with gray background in the message stream on a Discord chat.

## Part 2: How to Change Text Style in Discord with Markdown?

As we mentioned previously, Markdown is completely text-based and has a very simple syntax. All you need to do to apply special formatting to your text is to enter a few special characters at the right places, and the appropriate effect (bold, italic…) will appear in the chat. Keep in mind that you can easily combine the formatting styles by using multiple commands at the same time.

Here is an overview of the most important options for changing text style in Discord, and you can preview the text style in real time before sending to friends:

![Change Text Style in Discord  - Basic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-change-text-style.jpg)

#### **How to Bold Text in Discord?**

A simple way to use bold text style is to add two asterisks (\*\*) at the beginning and the end of the text that you want to have this effect.

#### **How to Italicize in Discord?**

Italicized style of text will be displayed in the chat if you put one asterisk character (\*) before and one more after the selected text.

#### **How to Write Strikethrough and Make Discord Cross Out Text?**

In order to get a strikethrough effect on your text, you will have to type two tilde characters (\~\~) on either side of the section of text that you want to change, and then you will create an appearance of a crossed-out portion of text.

#### **How to Make Discord Underline Text?**

Underline effect is also available on Discord and equally simple to activate. Just type two underscore dashes (\_\_)at the start and the ending of the text selection to apply it.

### How to Combine Text Formatting Options in Discord?

Once you mastered the basic effects and know the commands without thinking, it’s time to consider more complex text transformations that combine more than one effect. In principle, Markdown lets you do this just as easily, for as long as you know all the right combinations of characters that produce the desired effect. Here are the detailed instructions for some of the most frequently utilized combos:

#### Underlined and Italicized text

For this elegant combination, use two underscore dashes (\_\_) followed by one asterisk (\*) before and after the selected text.

![Discord Underlined and Italicized text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-text.jpg)

#### Underlined and Bolded text

Put two underscore dashes (\_\_) and add two asterisk characters (\*\*) to both sides of the selection to get those two effects together.

![Discord Underlined and Bolded text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Underlined, Italicized, and Bolded text

This combination is achieved by placing two underscore marks (\_\_) and three straight asterisks (\*\*\*) at the beginning as well as the end of the text.

![Discord Underlined &  Italicized Bolded  text  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-underlined-italicized-bolded-text.jpg)

#### Bolded, Italicized, underlined, and crossed out text

You can combine all four style changes as well – just use two tildes (\~\~), two underscores (\_\_) and three asterisks (\*\*\*) on either side of your text.

## Part 3: How to Use Code Block for Discord Text Formatting?

In addition to simple font transformations, Discord allows users to engage in advanced text formatting with incredible ease. One way to do it is to deploy code blocks, which can be activated with the backtick character ( \` ) placed on the beginning and the end of a text section. This command will highlight the chosen part of the text while preserving blank space around it for extra emphasis of your message. However, if you use three consecutive ( \` ) signs before a block of text and separate the text into several lines by pressing enter, the result will be a series of highlighted lines that form a single code block. This option is simple enough that even beginners with no programming abilities can easily learn how to use it, and it has some practical applications that savvy Discord users are very fond of.

## Part 4: How to Change the Text Color in Discord Message?

It’s not possible to alter the default text color from the native user interface in Discord. However, there is a simple solution to this problem that involves the highlight.is scrip mentioned earlier in the article. This Javascript-based library can transform the normal text into a code block consisting of three lines, where the middle line would be your selection of text in an alternative color. This is a neat workaround that’s very simple to activate using the same kind of text-based commands described above.

To change the text color, you should create a simple, three-line block. In the top line, you need to put three backtick characters (”’) along with a code phrase corresponding to the text color you would like to use. In the second line, you should type your entire text normally, while the bottom line should include three more backticks. You can create new lines by pressing the Shift and Enter keys at the same time.

Here is a detailed video tutorial for creating customized text in a range of different colors with all the relevant code phrases.

## FAQs About Discord Text Formatting

#### 1\. What is the default Discord font?

Discord uses the same basic font all over the entire platform, including all chats between users and in your profile info. This is Uni sans font, which is quite simple and belongs to the sans serif family of fonts that are known for good readability on almost any background.

#### 2\. How do you get different fonts on Discord?

It’s not possible to change the font directly from the Discord app, but this limitation can be circumvented if you find a good[Discord font generator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the internet. Those are very easy to use, so you can simply type your text in a chosen font and copy it back into Discord already formatted.

#### 3\. How to make a hidden text in Discord?

The creation of a hidden text message that requires direct user action to reveal is possible in Discord and requires a so-called spoiler tag. If you precede your message with the text /spoiler or type two slash bars ( //) at either side, it will be hidden from other users except for those who decide to view it and indicate their desire by clicking or tapping on it. Messages of this kind appear highlighted with gray background in the message stream on a Discord chat.

Before that – why would you want to add friends on Discord? Well, why not! You can chat with them personally, show off your gaming skills by streaming games, or add them to your servers!

## Part 1: How to Add Friends on Discord on Computer?

Discord is supposed to make gaming an interactive and lively experience. So, you should start adding friends right away. Here are the steps for adding friends on Discord. The process is the same for the desktop app and browser Discord. You can add friends through two ways -

1. The friend will appear in your friend list once they accept your friend request.

1. Open the server that you and your friend are a part of.
2. Tap on your friend’s profile. You can find their profile in the user list of the server.

![ add friends on Discord server](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-server.jpg)

To do this, open your chat list by clicking on your profile. Find the person you want to add to the chat list, and right-click on their profile. Tap the ‘Add Friend’ option. This is the fastest way to add friends on Discord without their user tag.

## Part 2: How to Add friends on Discord on Android and iOS?

The user interface of discord is more or less the same across various devices. The process of adding friends is quite similar to the one we discussed for the computer.

You cannot use discord over a phone's browser. To use discord on your phone, you have to download the app. It is available on Google Play Store and App Store. Once you have downloaded the app and logged in, here is **how to add people on Discord**.

### 1\. How to Add friends directly on Discord Mobile

If you have some friends that you do not share common channels with, you can add them directly with their username and Discord tag. Make sure you note down their user name and tag.

1. Open the discord app.
2. Tap on the Friends button that is located towards the bottom.

![ add friends on Discord mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friend-on-discord-mobile.jpg)

4. Your friend request will be sent. The friend would be visible in your friend's list once they have approved your friend request.

Once your friend is added, you can directly message them or call them.

### 2\. How to add friends on Discord Server

discord is all about stumbling upon like-minded people and growing your gaming group. Once you join a server, you are bound to make a lot of friends. And sometimes, you might want to add them to your friend's list so you can text them personally.

Follow these steps to add a friend that you met on the server.

1. Open your discord app.
2. Click open the server that you and your friend are a part of.
3. Open the list of channel users. The button for the list is located towards the top at the right corner.
4. Find your friend on the list. When you find your friend, tap on their profile.

2. Once they approve, they will be a part of your friend list.

Likewise, you can build a community of your own by creating a new server. You can invite your friends or people that you met while playing games or obsessing over some fandom.

## Part 3: How to Find Someone and Add Friends on Discord Without Number

In case you have been using discord for a while, you might have realized that the only way to add friends is by username and the Discord tag number. However, there is a way to add friends without the tag. And here is how to do it –

1. Open the Discord app on your phone.
2. Tap those ‘three parallel lines’ buttons located on the top left.
3. Tap the Friends symbol that appears on the bottom tab.
4. Tap on the ‘Add Friends’ button and you will see two tabs: Username and Nearby Scan. Select the Nearby Scan option.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile without numbers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-mobile-without-number.jpg)

1. Ask your friend to turn on the Nearby Scan mode on their phone too.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile with nearby scan feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-nearby-scan-discord.jpg)

1. When your friend gets detected, they appear on the radar.
2. Hit the ‘Send’ button to send a Friend Request.
3. Once they accept your request, they will make their way to your Friends List.

Note that this method only works on the mobile app (it doesn't matter if you have an Android phone or iPhone). You cannot perform this with a PC or laptop.

Further, you and your friend both must be on the Nearby Scan mode to connect with this feature. This method only works for connections that are within a 10-meter radius. So, if your pal is from a whole different continent, you will need a user tag to add them as friends.

If you and the person you want to add are on the same server, you can add them through the channel user lists, as we discussed above.

## Bonus: How to Add friends on Discord without user tag via an invitation link

On Discord channels, it always ‘the more, the merrier.’ And your server can be one lonely place without friends. Plus, adding friends via a server is a lot easier and needs fewer steps. Create a server and customize it according to your taste. Don’t forget to add bots for fun!

1. Open your discord, and head over to the server that you want to add friends to.
2. Right-click on the server title. A menu with several options will appear.
3. From that list, choose ‘invite friends’ and an invite link will appear on the pop-up menu.

![add friends to Discord Server via invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-to-discord-server-via-invitation-link.jpg)

1. The invitation link typically expires in a day. But you can change this setting to ‘set this link to never expire.

![set Discord invitation links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-discord-invitation-link.jpg)

1. Share this link with your friends over other social media apps to invite them.
2. Your friends will show up on the member list of your channel when they accept your invite and follow the link.
3. From here, you can right-click on the profile that you want to add as your Friend.
4. From the drop-down that appears, tap on the ‘Profile’ option.
5. The profile opens up. Here, click on the ‘send friend request’ option.

The person will receive the request. Upon approval, the friend will be added to your Friends list. This method does not require a user tag, and you can directly add your friends through the channel member's list.

2. Tap those ‘three parallel lines’ buttons located on the top left.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile without numbers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-on-discord-mobile-without-number.jpg)

1. Ask your friend to turn on the Nearby Scan mode on their phone too.

![ add friends to server on Discord mobile with nearby scan feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-friends-nearby-scan-discord.jpg)

1. When your friend gets detected, they appear on the radar.
2. Hit the ‘Send’ button to send a Friend Request.
3. Once they accept your request, they will make their way to your Friends List.

Note that this method only works on the mobile app (it doesn't matter if you have an Android phone or iPhone). You cannot perform this with a PC or laptop.

Further, you and your friend both must be on the Nearby Scan mode to connect with this feature. This method only works for connections that are within a 10-meter radius. So, if your pal is from a whole different continent, you will need a user tag to add them as friends.

If you and the person you want to add are on the same server, you can add them through the channel user lists, as we discussed above.

## Bonus: How to Add friends on Discord without user tag via an invitation link

On Discord channels, it always ‘the more, the merrier.’ And your server can be one lonely place without friends. Plus, adding friends via a server is a lot easier and needs fewer steps. Create a server and customize it according to your taste. Don’t forget to add bots for fun!

1. Open your discord, and head over to the server that you want to add friends to.
