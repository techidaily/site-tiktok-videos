* [Part 3: Other Options to Deactivate TikTok Accounts](#part3)

## How to Delete an Account?

Only a short while ago users of the TikTok platform had to contact the customer support in order to delete their accounts. However, the recent introduction of the **'Thinking about removing your account'** option has made this task much quicker. Here's how you can delete a TikTok account permanently in just a few easy steps.

#### Step 1

You must first **add a phone number** to a TikTok account before you can proceed to delete it. After you've launched the app, click on the **Profile Information** icon in the lower right corner of the app's window. Tap on the **Settings option** and then select the **Privacy and Settings feature** from the menu that pops up on the screen. Choose the **Manage my Account** option from the Settings menu, then locate the **Phone Number feature** and tap on it to insert your phone number. The app will send a **one-time password (OTP)** to your phone, so you just have to enter the **verification code** into the appropriate box, and your phone will be connected to your TikTok account.

#### Step 2

Afterward, you should once again tap on the **Profile Information** icon in the lower right corner.

Keep in mind that your account cannot be recovered once it is deleted and that all information that wasn't saved on it such as chat messages is going to remain visible to other users of the TikTok platform after you deactivate your account.

## Think Twice Before Deleting Your Account

If you don't want to lose all the videos you shared on TikTok you should download them from your profile to your phone because all the data that was stored on your account is going to be deleted. What's more, you will not receive a refund for any in-app purchases you made while you were using TikTok. If you would only like to go on a social media hiatus for a while, the app offers some advanced options that will enable you to keep your account while remaining completely invisible on the platform. Here are some of the solutions you might want to consider before deciding to delete your TikTok account forever.

## 3 Alternatives to Deleting a TikTok Account

The platform offers several advanced options to its users that enable them to be hidden from the public eye. That's why you don't have to deactivate your TikTok account if you don't want your music videos to be accessible to other users of the platform. Here are a few alternative options you have at your disposal.

#### Set Privacy Settings to Private

The TikTok app can be used in **Private mode,** even though all accounts on the platform are **Public** when you first create them. All new followers will have to send you a friend request in order to view your videos once you switch to private mode, which enables you to control who can see the content you share on your account. This option can be activated by heading over to the **Settings menu** and choosing the **Privacy and Safety feature.** Afterward, you just have to toggle the **Private Account option** **on**, and after a short while, only your followers will be able to see the content you post on TikTok.

#### Prevent Other Users From Finding You

The '**Allow others to find me'** option lets you control who can see your profile because if you enable it, your account won't appear in the friend suggestions other users receive from the platform. You can find this option in the **Privacy and Safety menu**, so you can just switch it off if it's enabled by default. You can switch it back on whenever you want if at any point you decide that you want to be featured in follower suggestions.

#### Control Who Can Send You Messages and Post Comments on Your Videos

Limiting the number of people who can get in touch with you through TikTok is another way to increase your safety on this video sharing platform. **Who can send me messages,** and **Who can send me comments** options are available in the **Privacy and Safety** menu, so you can easily set both of these options to **Just Friends** if you'd like to avoid receiving messages from TikTok users you don't know.

### Conclusion

The recent updates of the app and the introduction of the Thinking about removing your account option made deleting a TikTok account a quick process. However, this action is permanent and once you deactivate your account, you won't be able to use it again. That's why you need to think about this decision through, especially because the app offers a number of ways to increase your privacy.

Start Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac PC, go to **File**  \> **New Project** and click **9:16 (Portrait)**  from the submenu that appears.

Click **Split Screen** from the standard toolbar at the top, hover mouse to the screen type preset you want to use, click the **\+**  ( **Add to Project** ) icon that appears at the bottom-right corner of the thumbnail, and click **OK**  from the bottom-right corner once the preset is added to the Timeline.

### 2\. Import and Add Video(s) Preview/Timeline

Click the **Media** button from the standard toolbar, click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left corner, and when the **Open** box comes up, select and import the video file(s) you want to participate in the **TikTok reaction**. Alternatively, you can also click **Record** from below the standard toolbar, and choose any of the options to record your own video or voice right from within Wondershare Filmora itself.

Next, click and drag each of the imported videos to their corresponding screen sections in the **Preview** window in the upper-right area. Notice how the files are automatically added to the Timeline at the bottom.

### 3\. Add Elements and Titles

Click **Elements** from the standard toolbar, hover mouse to the element you want to add to the reaction, click the **\+**  icon that appears at the center of the thumbnail, and reposition the element in the Timeline to match the duration with that of the reaction you are creating.

### 4\. Export the Reaction

![Filmora9  export options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-video.jpg)

Click **EXPORT**  from the top-middle section of the interface, go to the **Local** tab from the top of the **Export** box that appears next, select your preferred format from the left bar, optionally choose a destination folder from the right window, optionally click **SETTINGS**  to fine-tune the output preferences as needed, and click **EXPORT**  from the bottom-right corner to export the **TikTok reaction**. Or, you can save it in the settings perfect for iPhone or another device.

Below is a sample reaction video made with Filmora, you can do much better than that for your TikTok account:

Besides using Filmora to edit reaction videos with the split-screen presets, you can also use some other [video editing software to create a reaction video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora can empower your video creation with more creativity, watch the video below and download Filmora to try.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

A **TikTok reaction** enables you to make the source videos more fun and entertaining. Luckily the app itself has a “React” button that helps you create **TikTok reaction videos** with merely a few simple taps. However, if you feel that the built-in options are not as robust as they should be, a third-party program like Wondershare Filmora is something you would definitely love to try your hands on as the software is not only easy to use, it is also lightweight, and doesn’t put any overhead on your computer hardware.
