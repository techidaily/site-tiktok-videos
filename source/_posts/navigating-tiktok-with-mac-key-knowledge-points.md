Social media language or terminologies are different from the ones you use in your daily communication. Almost all social media sites engage you with different terms like DP, which means display picture. TikTok is no exception and throws you with different acronyms.

PFP is one of the most widely acknowledged and used acronyms on TikTok. So, there is hardly any TikTok user unaware of PFP. Do you know what does PFP actually means? If not, don’t worry!! The following article will explain to you everything about PFP, from its meaning to its use. Let’s get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is PFP on TikTok](#part1)

02 [What is the PFP hashtag on TikTok?](#part2)

03 [How to Change Profile Pictures on TikTok?](#part3)

04 [How to Get More Funny PFPs on TikTok with Hashtag?](#part4)

05 [How to Make TikTok PFP?](#part5)

06 [TikTok PFP FAQs](#part6)

## Part 1: What is PFP on TikTok?

PFP corresponds to Profile Picture on TikTok. Unlike other social media platforms, TikTok users use PFPs to denote profile pictures. On the contrary, only PP is used for the profile picture on other mainstream social media sites. Moreover, PFP is used for Picture For Proof on social media sites, except TikTok. So, PFP is asked as proof to show your current activity. In addition, it may also be requested as your identity proof. However, when you see PFP on TikTok, your only concern should be your profile picture.

## Part 2: What is the PFP hashtag on TikTok?

Hashtags are used to emphasize a specific topic that is in the spotlight. Moreover, hashtags may also manifest trends on different social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc. On TikTok, hashtags are added to help TikTok users navigate your content. So, if you have tagged your content with a specific hashtag, your post is likely to appear in the content list for someone searching for a relevant hashtag.
