## Why do you Need to Go Live on TikTok?

In this competitive world, one cannot wait for the news crews to live, so social media applications like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram have been gaining a giant notice in recent days.

Although chats, video calls, status updates, stickers, gif images, amazing smileys are in existence to make the communication within individuals more active, the users require something realistic, and this is where live streaming comes of great help.

Among the emerging platforms, TikTok is becoming a popular one used by more than 600 million users, especially recognized as the ‘lip-syncing app”. It allows users to make live videos, share video clips, add various AR filter effects, and synchronizing with musical tracks.

Globally, Tiktok is in the top 10 social media applications that help create video content in minutes that can be creative or fun-oriented by the inclusion of masks, stickers, effects, sounds, and so on.

Currently, many individuals are interested in making live videos, and this is where the competition between tiktokers rises. The primary users of TikTok are adults and teens-this is what makes TikTok the best live streaming platform.

## How to Prepare before Live Streaming on TikTok?

* Users these days are restricted to use banned words to their live videos. The list includes BFF, follow, fan, duet, donation and drama queen, etc. It is better to use some alternating words to make your video valuable online.
* In case if you are not able to see the Live Button on the screen; the chances are that your device is doing some audio recording because the Live option disappears during such recordings. There is no need to go to any song rather you have to hit the Plus+ button available on the bottom of the screen, and soon a video button will appear on the screen, besides this button; you will also find the option to Go Live.
* Some rumors say that the Tik Tok app allows only 1k fans to go live at an instant; however, reports say that this count keeps on varying in different countries.

* Note that, Go Live feature is currently in the testing phase; hence, it is not available to all users. In order to use this feature, it is important to use the latest version of the TikTok app.
* Users these days are restricted to use banned words to their live videos. The list includes BFF, follow, fan, duet, donation and drama queen, etc. It is better to use some alternating words to make your video valuable online.
* In case if you are not able to see the Live Button on the screen; the chances are that your device is doing some audio recording because the Live option disappears during such recordings. There is no need to go to any song rather you have to hit the Plus+ button available on the bottom of the screen, and soon a video button will appear on the screen, besides this button; you will also find the option to Go Live.
* Some rumors say that the Tik Tok app allows only 1k fans to go live at an instant; however, reports say that this count keeps on varying in different countries.

**Conclusion:**

Probably, now you have collected all the essential information about the Go Live feature of the TikTok app. This is another interesting thing to do online but make sure you have an updated version of the app to start creating your own live streams using TikTok. Prefer to use some interesting captions for your live videos so that they can capture more attention online.
