**Step 5:** Then, choose **Next**, write a title and any other required information, and afterward tap on **Post** to finish the TikTok video production.

## Part 2: How to Edit and Customize Text on TikTok?

While you can add text to your TikTok videos, that's not the only thing you can do with adding text. TikTok offers you the chance to further customize the video by making modifications to the added text. Here are three ways in which you can further customize your TikTok video:

**1\. How to Put Text on TikTok and Make It Disappear?**

TikTok allows you to control when your text that appears onscreen. The single condition is that it must be visible for at least one full second. All you have to do now is follow these steps to determine the length of your content.

**Step 1:** Tap on the **Text** you want to edit.

**Step 2:** You'll need to pick **Set duration** to change the time of the text on your video. This will take you to a panel where you can control when the text displays and, if necessary, when it fades away. **_Drag the timing bar_** so that it fits perfectly to choose a start and finish time.

**Step 3:** **_Drag the red box_** around the bottom of the timeline to choose when the text should appear.

![adjust text duration tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-text-duration-tiktok-video.jpg)

**Step 4:** Tap the **Checkmark** in the bottom right-hand corner once you're done.

**2\. How to Change TikTok Text, Font, and Size?**

Customization of your textual videos on TikTok isn't restricted to adding and disappearing the text or adding multiple lines of text. You also change the text font and size of your captions by using these steps:

**Step 1:** By tapping the **A** on the left side of the display, you can **_Highlight_** the text.

**Step 2:** You can alter the **Fonts** by picking an alternative from the **_multi-colored circles_** at the bottom of the display.

![change texts font tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-texts-font-tiktok-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** TikTok further allows you to alter the color by choosing an alternative from the **Color options** provided on the top-left side of the text menu.

**3\. How to Add Multiple Lines of Text to Your TikTok?**

One line of text isn't always sufficient. You can add your first in-video caption by completing the procedures outlined above. Then follow these steps to learn how to use the TikTok editor to add various texts to your clips.

**Step 1:** Tap the **Text** button once again once you've added your first line of text to your video.

**Step 2:** **Type** the new caption line.

![add multiple texts tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-multiple-texts-tiktok-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** Choose a **Font** and a **Color**. Don't forget to tap **Done.**

## Part 3: How to Add Background Color to Text on TikTok?

Right when you thought the video editing with textual effects was limited to this point, TikTok decided to surprise you further. You might have seen your Instagram fellow members use a dark background behind their text in several stories, videos, posts, haven't you? We assumed so.

But did you know you can use a similar effect to post or share videos on TikTok too? Even if you didn't, it's not a problem. Because in this part, we will tell you how you can use the help of Instagram and add background color to text on TikTok.

**Step 1:** You access the Story recording view by clicking the **\+ icon** on the interface. Then you either record live video or use video from the gallery collection.

**Step 2:** Select the **letter Aa** in the video interface to enter the text you wish to appear in the video. You may change the font and size of the text displayed below.

**Step 3:** Choose a **black backdrop** for the text by clicking on the **letter A** with two asterisks above. Then press the **Next** button. There are two tiles for applying text effects to the letter **A symbol**.

![add backdrop tiktok video text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-backdrop-tiktok-video-text.jpg)

**Step 4:** As a result, we produced a text effect vide a dark backdrop. To save videos to your device's album, click the **Download** symbol.

**Step 5:** To capture video, **Launch the TikTok** application and tap the **\+ icon**. To access the gallery on the smartphone and pick the video to download from Instagram, click **Upload** squares in the touch interface.

**Step 6:** Lastly, you can add extra elements to the video, such as _filters_ and _stickers,_ before uploading it to your TikTok account.

## Part 4: How to Add Text to Video in Filmora?
