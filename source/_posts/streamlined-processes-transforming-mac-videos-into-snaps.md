One of the best features of Snapchat that makes it so attractive among the young audience is its mobile-oriented user interface.

## What Are the Ideal Features of a Snapchat Video?

Snapchat is highly optimized for vertical viewing which means that all the content needs to be served in portrait aspect ratio instead of landscape used by YouTube and other video platforms. You need to ensure that every aspect of your video is perfect before you can upload it for Snapchat on Mac. Here are some of the key features that you must not forget.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/snapchat.jpg)

* **Resolution** \- The ideal resolution of a Snapchat video is **1080 x 1920** pixels which is known as full HD. This resolution will ensure that your video loads in the right way and remains sharp and crisp for an excellent viewing experience.
* **Video Format** \- The recommended video format for Snapchat clips is **MP4 and MOV. Y**ou can use either of those formats on your Mac.
* **Aspect Ratio** \- This is one of the key aspects of any video that determines the orientation of viewing. For a perfect Snapchat video, it is recommended that you keep the aspect ratio to **9:16**.
* **Video Length Size** \- Remember that Snapchat isn't like YouTube and serves an audience that wants micro-entertainment. This is why the recommended time for your video is **3 to 10 seconds** with the video size **not exceeding 32 MB**. Otherwise, the Snapchat audience may not respond well to your videos.

That is why it is crucial that your Snapchat video has all the ideal features so your audience can enjoy the viewing experience as intended instead of attempting to manipulate their phones to be able to see the video clearly. It will create an unpleasant and frustrating experience and your viewers might not stay with you.

2. Cropping Your Video for Snapchat

Here you can use the 'Crop and Zoom' button from the Timeline by right-clicking on it, so you can only focus on the aspect of the video that you want to show. This will resize the video as well.

3. Cutting the Video

Another option you have is to delete the unnecessary parts of the video by selecting them through the indicator present on the timeline. Once you have selected the parts you don't need, right-click on them and select 'Delete'.

4. Exporting Your Snapchat Video

Once you have resized your video by cropping and cutting the media file, you can now export it in the right resolution, bit rate, and format to ensure you get the minimum file size.

## Perfect Pairing: Transferring Camera Roll Content Effortlessly to Snapchat

Many people haven't backed up their camera roll to Snapchat due to the default settings. If you want to save each photo or video from your device on the Snapchat cloud, backing up the camera to the Memories is necessary. By doing so, you cannot lose important photos or videos from your phone.

If you change the default settings of the Memories created from the camera roll, Snapchat will automatically create a backup of your Memories. In this regard, this article will guide you on **how to back up the camera roll to Snapchat** in the easiest way.

## Part 1: Backing up automatically - Creating Snapchat Stories from your Camera Roll

If you don't want to alter the settings of your camera roll, this part will offer you an easy method. Through this method, you can create Snapchat stories from the camera roll directly. By doing so, you can instantly save the camera roll photos to your Snapchat without backing up. To make a Snapchat story from your camera roll, read the following instructions:

Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up from the bottom. Head to the Camera Roll section and select any photo.

![access camera roll](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-1.jpg)

Step2 After selecting a particular photo or video, hit the "Arrow" icon. Afterward, tap on the "My Story" option to create a story. For confirmation, press the "Arrow" icon again. This will create a Snapchat story instantly from your Camera Roll.

## Part 2: How to Backup your Camera Roll to Snapchat without Creating Stories

In Snapchat, you can only save the camera roll videos having a maximum of 10-second length. It indicates that you cannot save the camera roll videos which exceed the 10-second limit. Furthermore, there are various ways that enable you to make a Camera Roll backup on Snapchat. In this part, we will guide you on how to save a Camera roll photo or video on Snapchat without creating a story. Also, these steps are applicable on both Android and iOS devices:

Step1 After opening your Snapchat app, open your Memories by swiping up. Proceed to your "Camera Roll" section and long-press on any picture. This will let you select any photo or video on your Camera Roll.

![open camera roll pictures](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-3.jpg)

Step2 Once you have selected the picture, choose the "Create Story" option. Afterward, tap on the "Save Story" option, which will save the camera roll picture in the Memories section.

## Part 3: How to Check Your Backup Progress

To ensure a complete backup of your Memories on Snapchat, a stable Wi-Fi connection is mandatory. That's why make sure to connect your phone with a stable and strong internet connection. Moreover, if you have chosen multiple photos or videos from the Camera Roll, you can save them as a story on Snapchat. However, if you want to save individual images, you will need to make their backup separately in Memories. To check your backup progress on Snapchat, navigate to the following steps:

Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, tap on your Bitmoji icon. From there, proceed to the "Settings" by tapping on the gear icon.

![open snapchat settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/back-up-camera-roll-to-snapchat-5.jpg)

Step2 Scroll down a little to find the option "Memories." Afterward, you can see the option "Backup Progress." If you can see the word "Complete," it means that your Memories are backed up completely. If not, connect your phone to a stable Wi-Fi connection.

## Part 4: How to Turn On the Smart Backup

A Smart Backup is an advanced option on Snapchat that lets you back up memories automatically. If you enable this feature, Snapchat will automatically create a backup through a stable internet connection. This feature allows you to easily access your Memories even if you reinstall Snapchat on another device. Moreover, you can save your phone's storage by saving photos or videos in Memories. To activate the Smart Backup feature, read the below instructions:

Step1 After opening Snapchat, head to its "Settings." In the Settings menu, locate the option "Memories."
