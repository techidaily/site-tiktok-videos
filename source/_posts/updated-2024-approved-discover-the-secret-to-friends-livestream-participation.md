## Part 1: What is TikTok Creator Fund?

TikTok’s Creator Fund program is a $200 million cash fund, growing to $1billion over the next 3 years, to reward TikTokers for creating authentic, entertaining, and engaging video content. Launched in 2020, the TikTok creator fund is the opportunity of a lifetime for determined video creators to earn per view on their original content.

From artists to educators, singers to dancers, comedians to bodybuilders, the TikTok creator fund allows the brightest TikTokers to earn money through their creative content. It is a type of incentive for the creators and a way for TikTok to express their gratitude to the creator community for their creativity and ingenuity. The goal of the fund is to support the brightest and best TikTok creators who draw audiences to the platform.

## Part 2: Who is Eligible to Apply to the Creator Fund?

TikTokers can apply for funding through the creator fund and generate income from their videos. Although there’s no limit on the number of creators who can join, there are certain TikTok creator fund requirements that creators have to meet to be able to access the program.

The initial criteria for applying to the TikTok creator fund are:

* Must be at least 18 years of age
* Should have at least 10, 000 followers

In other words, the creator fund is for content creators who have already proven their ability to make popular content. If you do not meet the above requirements, you won’t be able to access the creator fund or the income it provides. So, unless you have a moderate level of popularity on TikTok, you won’t be able to qualify to receive money from the creator fund. However, you can set your focus on the creator fund program and grow your account to match the TikTok Creator Fund requirements!

## Part 2: Who is Eligible to Apply to the Creator Fund?

TikTokers can apply for funding through the creator fund and generate income from their videos. Although there’s no limit on the number of creators who can join, there are certain TikTok creator fund requirements that creators have to meet to be able to access the program.

The initial criteria for applying to the TikTok creator fund are:

* Must be at least 18 years of age
* Should have at least 10, 000 followers
* Must be based in the US, UK, France, Spain, Germany, or Italy
* Should have at least 100,000 views in the last 30 days
* Only post “original content” in line with the TikTok Community Guidelines

In other words, the creator fund is for content creators who have already proven their ability to make popular content. If you do not meet the above requirements, you won’t be able to access the creator fund or the income it provides. So, unless you have a moderate level of popularity on TikTok, you won’t be able to qualify to receive money from the creator fund. However, you can set your focus on the creator fund program and grow your account to match the TikTok Creator Fund requirements!

## Part 5: Top 5 Highest Paid TikTokers

Before we delve into the richest TikTokers, it is recommended to know what TikTok creator Fund pays to users. So far, TikTok hasn’t officially announced what or how much it pays its creators. The creator fund isn’t a grant or an ad revenue-sharing program. However, influencers who are enrolled in the Creator Fund have reported that TikTok pays them between 2 and 4 cents per 1000 views.

TikTok Creator Fund payout depends on a range of factors in relation to your profile and the content you create. These factors include views count and their authenticity, number of engagement, the region where the views come from, and total followers compared to likes. Performance on this social media platform is dynamic as it changes naturally. Besides, the daily funding amount can differ depending on the number of videos released on that day. So, the specific amount differs from one person to another.

Now that you have an idea of the creator fund payout, you might be wondering about top TikTok creators who have monetized their content. Here’s a list of TikTok’s 5 highest paid TikTokers based on Forbes’ list of the highest-earning stars in 2020:
