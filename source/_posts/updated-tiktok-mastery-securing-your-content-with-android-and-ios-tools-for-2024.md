## Method 2: Save TikTok Video Online

TikTok downloader, a.k.a TTDownloader is an online tool to help you save your favorite videos from the wonderful library of TikTok. But why use an online tool? Because of the following advantages, it offers:

* Save TikTok video to any device like PC, android, iOS, or tablet.
* Save it in any format, MP3, or MP4.
* Choose to remove the watermark.
* There's no need to download the app. Only the video's URL is needed.
* No registration or installation of the downloader is needed.
* The platform offers free and unlimited downloads.

I'm sure this is enough to convince you but wait till you see how easy it is to use. Follow these steps and see for yourself what the fuss is all about. Here you go:

1\. Open 'www.ttdownloader.com' in the browser.

## Method 3: Save TikTok Video by a Third-Party App

TikMate is a TikTok video downloading app available on the Google store. It offers super-fast downloading and is free. You can download unlimited videos, and it doesn't even require logging in. I know that can be tiring and instantly makes you hate the app. With that settled, let me add that it is not just a downloader, but also a video player! How cool. And all the downloaded videos are in the app, so you don't have to search your gallery looking for it.

Some apps have complicated interfaces, but TikMate once again wins us over with its simplicity. Only a few quick steps, and you'll have your favorite video saved.

1\. Download TikMate from the Google store and launch it.
