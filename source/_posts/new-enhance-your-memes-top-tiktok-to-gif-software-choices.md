TikTok videos may benefit from adding effects, which is a simple process. You may do it during the recording process or after the fact in post-production. One viral effect is slow-motion. You can use this to create some quite amusing videos, particularly when combined with other effects.

In this section, we'll go through how to record a TikTok video with the slow-mo effect.

**Step 1**: The first step is to **Open Tik Tok**, which can be accomplished by searching for the program on your smartphone. When you first launch TikTok, it will open in the feed area by default, as seen below. Navigation to the new video screen requires one press on the **\+ symbol** at the bottom of your screen, as seen in the image below before it will appear.
