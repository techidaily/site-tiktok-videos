## Other Visual Effects For Your Tik Tok Dance

Other than motion tracking several other effects can make your Tik Tok dance alluring and special. Here are some of them.

### Green Screen for TikTok Dance

This is also one of the most famous effects that are used for the Tik Tok dance challenge. Green Screen in a built-in app effect that allows you to add any background to your current video. Tik Tok provides some default backgrounds to its users but you can also choose from your camera roll.

### Double Screen Effect for TikTok Dance

 This effect allows you to have two screens at once. The brilliant thing about this effect is that you can perform different actions on both screens and also create an illusion of moving from one screen to another. This effect can help make some creative Tik Tok dance videos depending on your imagination.

### Trio Effect for TikTok Dance

This effect allows you to make two other clones of yourself. Now imagine three of you dancing together on some good choreography. Sounds sensational; doesn’t it? When using trio, both of your clones will be doing the same moves, you cannot assign different moves to your clones.

All of this can be achieved with just one top of the line video editing software that is Wondershare’s FilmoraX. So, start your challenges today with the tips and tricks provided and go viral, be famous.
