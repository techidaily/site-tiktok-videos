In addition, you can simply fast forward and rewind video recordings on a computer with relative ease. To learn more, just follow these easy steps:

**Step 1:** Log in to your TikTok account by going to the TikTok website on your PC.

**Step 2:** Once you're on the home page, click on any video that you may wish to view.
