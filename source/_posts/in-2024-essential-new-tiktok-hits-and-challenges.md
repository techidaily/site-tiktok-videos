TikTok has also become global. It is available in 75 different languages. It is available in more than 155 countries. According to the official statistics of TikTok, 90% of the users access the platform on a daily basis.

Many people ask if trends are good for branding. Sure, it does play a significant role in connecting you to the audience but you still need to understand the culture that you will be serving. If you don’t, you won’t be able to connect with your audience through your work.

When it comes to TikTok, it is just like your high school days. So, the first step to becoming successful is to find out what is popular and be a part of it. However, there is a little more to it than just that.

On TikTok and any other social media, trending content comes with full marketing potential. By following the trends, you can draw in a large base of a highly engaged audience. Also, algorithms recognize the popular trend content. Thus, when you get involved, you can improve your reach and start growing your account.

## Part 3: How to Find Trends on TikTok?

Here are the three ways to find the latest trends on this platform.

### Go Over the Discover Page

It is the best place to start looking for the trending hashtags, sounds, and challenges. You will find the latest hashtags and trends under the trends section.

### Spot Up-and-Coming Trends

The TikTok algorithm doesn’t curate trends and thus, whatever you find on the For Your Page is a mix of trending videos. But remember, the trends don’t last for more than 5-7 days.

### Follow Trending Creators

One of the best ways to find new trends is to follow all trending creators who jump on the latest trends.

### Conclusion

New TikTok trends are being introduced every day. So, make sure you keep a check. To create your TikTok videos, you can use the Filmora editing tool and make use of its features.
