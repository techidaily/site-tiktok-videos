But, then again, it comes out to be on producing a likable content. Brand yourself in a particular niche or interest, as we have mentioned already.

#### Engage the audience

Engagement means when people are spending most of their time on your TikTok videos. So, it depends upon what you have made. Do not put any kind of boring content as it can lead to bounce rates just like Google. The practical method of audience engagement is looking from their perspective. Think about your followers and their likings.

#### Increase followers and likes

Here are some tips to increase your likes and followers on TikTok.

* Avoid copied content and post only original content.
* Be consistent in posting videos.
* Integrate popular TikTok songs or music.
* Perform duets.
* Follow your expert creators.
* Get your way on trends and hashtags.
* Use quality equipment and software for editing purposes.
* Follow others to gain followers.
* Improve photography or shooting skills.
* Share it on other social media platforms.

### Part 3: Deal with the Feedbacks and Comments from your Fans and Haters

Dealing with your fans and haters is also vital to keep along with creating TikTok videos. Give replies, if possible, and always pay due respect to your fans. It doesn't mean that you have to indulge in intense fights with haters. Trolls are everywhere, so it's better to ignore them until the situation is life-threatening.

### Conclusion

When you are a **TikTok influencer** or even any other social media marketer, each of your action impacts millions of people. So, try to be original and create eye-catchy videos to rank better, among others. Follow all the tips mentioned above, including the versatile video editing software.

## Viral Videos & Lawfulness: Pre-Upload Copyright Verification

So, you have successfully created an awesome TikTok video with the perfect dance moves and accurate lip-sync. But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!

The reason?

Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!

This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.

So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?

To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.

And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.

## **Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?**

To avoid getting banned!

You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.

The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.

If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.

To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.

But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?

Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Therefore, if you’re posting a sound other than one from TikTok’s library, you can check if it’s copyrighted or not from your PC.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

## **Conclusion**

While making TikTok videos is quite a fun activity, we have to follow the rules, especially those revolving around using copyrighted material. According to TikTok’s policies, if a video has copyrighted sound, it will be muted, and if the video itself is copyrighted, like a clip from a movie or song, it will be taken down.

However, if you continue posting copyrighted content even after receiving copyright infringement notices from TikTok, it can result in your getting shut down for good!

Therefore, it’s good to know how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading through the steps explained in the article.

So, run a copyright check, and play it safe!
