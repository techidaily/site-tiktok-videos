## Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Mac OS

TikTok users like you flock to the app due to its entertainment value, global reach, and ease of use. When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.

The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.

1. You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.

2. Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.

3. Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.

4. After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.

5. Once the video is uploaded, you will be asked to put in a caption. We advise you to keep the caption quirky and fun. Another quick tip is that you should use hashtags that are trending at the moment as that will increase the visual appearance of your video more.

6. Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.

What about the videos you have already recorded on your TikTok application? Can you slow them down too? The following steps illustrate how to apply a slow-motion effect to your TikTok videos once they have been recorded using the app.

It is simple to record a video by simply going to the "Add new" area and selecting the video of your choosing to record. When you've finished recording, choose the next choice from the drop-down menu. Following that, you may proceed with the procedure.

**Step 1**: Once you've arrived at the next screen, you'll need to click on the **Circular clock** symbol to activate the effect. It is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, as seen below.

**Tip:** To access it, click on it. To access the effects, tap on it once. The effects under the **Filter** effects section will be immediately activated.

Step 2: To use this feature, you must browse the Time Effects part of the effects section. To do so, choose "**Time effects**" from the drop-down menu in the bottom right corner of the screen, as shown by the arrow in the image below. It will provide you with different temporal effects.

**Step 3:** It is necessary to choose the **Slow Motion** option from the list of alternatives that appears, as shown in the figure below. This will give the video the appearance of being in slow motion.

**Tip**: Changing the length of the slow-motion is accomplished by dragging the green square that appears on the screen. **Drag it** to any portion of the page where you want the slow-motion effect to appear.

**Step 4:** Once you're pleased with the effect, you may save it by selecting the save option from the menu. As seen in the illustration below, click on "**Save**" will save your work.

**(Note**: You will be returned to the previous screen if you do so. After that, you may edit it with whatever filters you want and publish it just like any other video).

## Part 3: How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?

### Kapwing

In a couple of seconds, Kapwing can speed up and slow down short videos. Slo-mo, timelapse, and hyperspeed films may be made with no editing skills then shared on social networking websites like YouTube.

Get started by uploading a video or pasting a URL. AVI, MP4, MOV, and 3PG are all supported formats by Kapwing. As slow as 0.25x for a slow-motion movie and as much as 4x for an enhanced video are available. Let's give you a step-by-step illustration:

**Step 1:** On TikTok, find the video you want to slow down and click on. You have the option of slowing down videos from other people's profiles and those from your profile. **Copy the URL** that appears when you click the **Share** button.

**Step 2:** This is where Kapwing comes in, and we utilize it on our PC using Chrome to accomplish our objective. Visit <https://www.kapwing.com/> and copy the URL of the TikTok video and paste it into Kapwing.

**Step 3:** Go to the Speed section, and use the – and + buttons to make the video slow down or speed up. After selecting "**slow-motion**" as your preferred speed, press the "**play**" button to begin watching the movie. If the video moves too slowly, click on the **Plus** sign and keep rewatching it until you're satisfied with the pace.

**Step 4**: This step is optional, but it comes in useful if you're performing in a duet or if you want to watch a TikTok video while you're not connected to the internet. Following your completion of the speed adjustment, go to the top of the studio and click **Export** **Video**. After your video has been processed, you may save it to your device by clicking the **Download** button.
