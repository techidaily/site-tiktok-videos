Cooking food is a lot of fun especially when the person in the video is full of energy. Their energy easily transfers in us and in no time we are enjoying cooking with them. One such person is Sonny Hurrel, a professional chef who makes delicious new recipes everytime.

The videos are packed with fun, interesting hacks and very easy to follow.

Sonny does not use too many intricate ingredients and neither uses complicated moves. His recipes are very simple for beginners and his sense of humor certainly adds to the fun.

### 12\. [The Moody Foody](https://www.tiktok.com/@theemoodyfoody)

Don’t we all just love satisfying videos, so imagine a satisfying food video account on TikTok which has two of our favourite things in it? Fabrizio Villalpando is an expert in cooking delicious food. He gets you addicted to his fantastic recipes and slow chopping videos.

The videos by The Moody Foody will envelop you in a calm and peaceful vibe. With light music playing in the background and smooth pealing and chopping sounds, you won’t be able to stop yourself from watching them. This is such a nice change from the hyperactive vibe of TikTok.

### 13\. [Thisisiona](https://www.tiktok.com/@thisisiona)

There are very few accounts on TikTok that show the importance of comfort food and how cooking and eating can be beautiful and enjoyable. If you love healthy food and enjoy making new recipes in the kitchen then you will love Iona’s whole vibe.

The videos are informational as well as fun. You get to learn a lot about cutting down toxic food choices and how to make healthy and delicious food. In case you are just a beginner, Thisisiona is a great place to start your new healthy cooking lifestyle.

### 14\. [What Willy](https://www.tiktok.com/@whatwilly)

There are certain food accounts on TikTok that are funny, but nothing matches what WhatWilly has in store for you. Will Huges not just cooks some tasty food for you but also is a great comedian, making you laugh while you are trying to follow the recipe.

His videos are the perfect balance of information and jokes that will make you laugh out loud.

So if you are a little bit down, we highly recommend you go to Will’s account and enjoy some comfort food and some laughs.

Other than cooking yummy new recipes, Eitan delves in recreating popular TikTok food trends and recreating popular restaurant chain food at home. Eitan started his journey when he was 12 and has been gaining followers since then with his fantastic energy and genuine vibe.
