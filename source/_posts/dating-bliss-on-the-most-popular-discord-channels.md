You have the option of downloading custom-built emojis or making an emoji that you would like to use on Discord.

Or you could animate them for all the more fun. All you have to do is upload an image. MakeEmoji will generate animated emojis that you can use in conversations on Discord to make them exciting and refreshing.

## Best Discord Emoji Making Apps for iPhone and Android

The good thing about Discord is that it's for everyone, regardless of the platform, device, or OS they may be using.

These Discord emoji maker applications are easy to use, intelligently designed, and, best of all, can be used on both iPhone and Android devices:

### 1\.  BITMOJI

With over 3 million downloads, Bitmoji is a top-rated application that's also linked with Snapchat.

It is the go-to app for teenagers and is considered one of the best and most popular third-party applications over the last year.

 The highly-customizable emojis created via this app could be your alter-egos because you can make them look just like you, making conversing highly interactive and fun.

Using Bitmoji is easy and straightforward. While the application earlier required you to create an avatar or an emoji from scratch, it now offers the option of selecting a picture and generating emojis and stickers.

 You can make changes or adjustments to your emoji if it's not what you imagined it to be. You may do this by directly customizing the appearance of your avatar. That includes changing hair, color, size or shape, and much more.

Furthermore, with Bitmoji you can:

* Create an expressive avatar
* Choose from a vast library of emojis

### 2\.  ZMOJI

This application is the perfect fit for you if you want to create and easily share customizable emojis with your friends. This is also used as a Discord emoji maker, but it may remind old users of the Bitmoji application, where you had no automated guidance.

You were left clear to experiment and use your creativity to start in and make emojis for yourself from scratch.

There is almost nothing in the application that you are not able to adjust.

This includes changing or adjusting the avatar features such as eyebrows and hairstyle to face type and clothing.

Once you've created ZMoji emojis for yourself, you can download them and send them over to your Discord server for upload.

ZMoji keyboard, an extension of the ZMoji application, is a must if you love animated emojis. It offers an extensive range of stickers, and you won't run out of options anytime soon.

However, some users might find that the biggest drawback of ZMoji is the number of ads on the platform and that the cost of a premium subscription is a touch more expensive.

### 3\.  EMOJILY

Another exciting Discord emote maker application that works as an emoji maker is Emojily.

The application offers several different designs to make your unique emoji and emoticon. You can label your emojis in many categories and find the perfect features such as eyes, eyebrows, mouths, hands, clothes, and even hats.

Users also appreciate the ability to directly share it to other platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Kik, or upload it to your Discord server is appreciated by users.

The standout feature of Emojly is a feature that they term a super feature called the randomize feature. It is designed to act as an automated super crazy creator and maker! This feature generates random emojis based on the labels decided by you. Pretty cool, right?

With Emojily, you have all the tools available to run your creativity wild and make the best emoji present.

While The Create Emoji is a free, customized extension of Emojily, you can only access limited elements in the free version. You may wish to subscribe to the paid version to establish more control over the design. Doing this will allow you to enjoy the more extensive experience Emojily has to offer.

## Conclusion

Making your emojis might sound like a difficult task, especially for Discord, but **Discord emoji maker** applications make the process fun and straightforward.

Popular apps like Bitmoji or MakeEmoji can create stickers or avatars. In contrast, Emojily and similar apps can be used to quickly make some detailed emotes.

All of these are incredibly well designed online tools and apps to make your experience of building your emoji a pleasant and worthwhile experience.
