Before proceeding further, it's essential to consider whether any copyright infringement issues could arise from downloading a TikTok video. According to the Community Guidelines of TikTok, users cannot post, send, or share any content that violates someone else's trademarks, copyrights, or intellectual property rights.

To prevent this, TikTok applies a watermark featuring both its accountâ€™s username and the logo that originally posted the content if someone downloads a TikTok video.

In other words, you have to ensure the watermark's visibility or give full credit to the user in another way while reposting the user's video on social media. And, this is where the job of the best TikTok converter MP4 comes in.

Cropping watermarks from your videos with Wondershare Filmora video editing software is a pretty straightforward process. You don't need be a professional to finish these simple editing actions.

All you must do is choose a method that best suits your preferences and performs an easy action, though.

So, without any delay, let's have a look at some editing techniques you can use to blur or crop watermarks from the downloaded videos of TikTok with Filmora.

![crop watermark filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-to-remove-watermark.jpg)

The crop window that enables you to use automatic aspect ratios or manually will appear on the screen. You can reposition the videos' corners of the cropping rectangle from here by dragging it as much as essential to remove TikTok's username watermark.

You can change the aspect ratios or keep them originally based on your needs. Hit the **OK** tab to apply the cropping effect, and you have successfully removed a watermark from your video.
