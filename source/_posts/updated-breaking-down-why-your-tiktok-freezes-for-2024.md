TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges. Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:

* Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network > Open ‘Advanced Options’

* Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone's screen.

If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users.
