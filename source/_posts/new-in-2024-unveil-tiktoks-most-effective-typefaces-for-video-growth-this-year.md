## How to Customize TikTok Fonts with Ease?

Usually, Tik Tok users can add text in two distinct places. The first among these is the place where you write your bio and enter your username in the application. Here, you can simply cut and paste any text you want. This includes the text you create using a TikTok fonts generator. On the other hand, the second is more complex. It is where you can add text as an overlay to the short videos you create using this application. You can add text to the video only after you shoot your video footage, i.e. – in the second stage of your video creation.

To start the video-creation process, click on the + icon located in the center bottom of your TikTok app. This will bring up the camera view. It is here that you will record the video clips and make some adjustments.

The next stage is where you need to make some fundamental decisions like if you will take videos using the app’s camera or whether you will be uploading other video clips. Also, you have to decide if you will use the flash and if you will record by setting a timer or pushing the big Record button.

Even though the video record screen will allow you to set a few creative options like adding effects, filters, and music to the video you are all set to record, you won’t be able to add text. You will have to record at least one video clip so that you can trim and add it together with other videos at the editing stage. It is at this editing stage that Tik Tok will provide you the opportunity to use text and customize it in your video.

Here’s how you can add and customize your text in TikTok videos-

Step-1: Click on the “Text” option (You will notice the **Aa** symbol above it)

Step-2: Type in the text you want in your video

Step-3: Customize your text by using the options available to you-

* By tapping on the **A** on the left side of your screen, you can highlight your text
* You will be able to change the text’s font through the options listed on the text menu’s top-left side. To change the color, choose an option from the colorful circles at the screen’s bottom

Step-4: when ready, click on **Done** on your screen’s top-right side. Keep in mind that you will be able to change the timing and placement of your text only after this point.

Step-5: Next, drag your text to the area where you want it to appear and then tap on it for more options.

Step-6: Choose **Set Duration** if you wish to adjust the timing of your text on the video. This will bring you to the screen where you will be able to adjust when the text appears and disappears.

Step-7: Tap on the play button situated just above the editing bar to see how your text looks. Once you are happy with it, choose the checkmark in the screen’s bottom-right corner.

Step-8: Click “Next” to simply continue in the video creation process to add a description and any other information you desire. Once done, hit **Post.**

## How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?

As simple as it may sound, using attractive TikTok fonts can help your videos get widely recognized, thus gaining more views. Using interesting fonts can not only increase your reach and help you create more engagement but also get you in front of your target audience.

Content is the King on TikTok, meaning that even accounts with zero followers can get thousands and millions of videos on new videos by using stylish fonts. Customizing your texts with cool fonts help you resonate with younger demographics, thus helping you build brand awareness with people who form to be the majority users in TikTok.

## Edit TikTok Videos with Versatile Video Editing Software

If you think the built-in editor of TikTok can't satisfy your personalized needs, why not try other video editors like Wondershare Filmora? One of the biggest advantages of this software is that its various types of effects will help your videos stand out from the crowd.

It is at this editing stage that Tik Tok will provide you the opportunity to use text and customize it in your video.

Here’s how you can add and customize your text in TikTok videos-

Step-1: Click on the “Text” option (You will notice the **Aa** symbol above it)

Step-2: Type in the text you want in your video

Step-3: Customize your text by using the options available to you-

* By tapping on the **A** on the left side of your screen, you can highlight your text
* You will be able to change the text’s font through the options listed on the text menu’s top-left side. To change the color, choose an option from the colorful circles at the screen’s bottom

Step-4: when ready, click on **Done** on your screen’s top-right side. Keep in mind that you will be able to change the timing and placement of your text only after this point.

Step-5: Next, drag your text to the area where you want it to appear and then tap on it for more options.

Step-6: Choose **Set Duration** if you wish to adjust the timing of your text on the video. This will bring you to the screen where you will be able to adjust when the text appears and disappears.

Step-7: Tap on the play button situated just above the editing bar to see how your text looks. Once you are happy with it, choose the checkmark in the screen’s bottom-right corner.

Step-8: Click “Next” to simply continue in the video creation process to add a description and any other information you desire. Once done, hit **Post.**

## How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?

As simple as it may sound, using attractive TikTok fonts can help your videos get widely recognized, thus gaining more views. Using interesting fonts can not only increase your reach and help you create more engagement but also get you in front of your target audience.

Content is the King on TikTok, meaning that even accounts with zero followers can get thousands and millions of videos on new videos by using stylish fonts. Customizing your texts with cool fonts help you resonate with younger demographics, thus helping you build brand awareness with people who form to be the majority users in TikTok.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

TikTok is pretty awesome, the next big thing in social media, both for brands and individuals.

Luckily, the lip-sync and dance and app can be a lot more than that if your brand uses it with purpose in mind. And the first place to begin with that aim is in your TikTok bio.

Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.

It's because you don't want to consume time to introduce yourself in every video, again and again, so your **TikTok bios** provide you with the opportunity to do just that. This is your chance to describe to your followers who you are and why they should be your followers.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Here, we'll cover how to add a link to TikTok bio, 30+ TikTok bio ideas, and other fantastic tools to upgrade your TikTok profile.

## Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps \[updated 2024\]

Writing a TikTok bio doesn't have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let's dig deeper into those ultimate steps!

**Step 1: Describe your brand.**

![describe account tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg)

Source: blog.hubspot.com

Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn't rely on that.

What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.

It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account's purpose efficiently.

**Step 2: Add emojis.**

Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand's personality and showcase your brand's services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.

For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).

So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors' action.

**Step 3: Add a CTA.**

Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.

Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.

**Step 4: Don't exceed the character limit**.

TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That's just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.

**Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.**

TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it's currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we'll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok's bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.

So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.

Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.

## Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?

First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you'd like.

The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.

You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.

**Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok**

Yet, there is a caveat to the **TikTok bio** link option: not everyone can add a link to their **TikTok bio**. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:

**Step 1**: Hit the **"Edit your profile"** tab

**Step 2**: Check for the option "**Website**" underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.

There's no issue if you don't have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called **Testflight** through the app store.

Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page's upper right-hand corner to enter the "**Settings**" window. Then, scroll down and click **"Join TikTok Testers."**

![tiktok beta](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg)

Follow those instructions, and you'll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.

Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.

## Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps \[updated 2024\]

Writing a TikTok bio doesn't have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let's dig deeper into those ultimate steps!

**Step 1: Describe your brand.**

![describe account tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg)

Source: blog.hubspot.com

Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn't rely on that.

What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.

It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account's purpose efficiently.

**Step 2: Add emojis.**

Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand's personality and showcase your brand's services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.

For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).

So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors' action.

**Step 3: Add a CTA.**

Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.

Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.

**Step 4: Don't exceed the character limit**.

TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That's just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.

**Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.**

TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it's currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we'll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok's bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.

So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.

Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.

## Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?

First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you'd like.

The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.

You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.

**Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok**

Yet, there is a caveat to the **TikTok bio** link option: not everyone can add a link to their **TikTok bio**. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:

**Step 1**: Hit the **"Edit your profile"** tab

**Step 2**: Check for the option "**Website**" underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.

There's no issue if you don't have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called **Testflight** through the app store.

Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page's upper right-hand corner to enter the "**Settings**" window. Then, scroll down and click **"Join TikTok Testers."**

![tiktok beta](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg)

Follow those instructions, and you'll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.

## Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024
