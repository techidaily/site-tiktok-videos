Social media language or terminologies are different from the ones you use in your daily communication. Almost all social media sites engage you with different terms like DP, which means display picture. TikTok is no exception and throws you with different acronyms.

PFP is one of the most widely acknowledged and used acronyms on TikTok. So, there is hardly any TikTok user unaware of PFP. Do you know what does PFP actually means? If not, don’t worry!! The following article will explain to you everything about PFP, from its meaning to its use. Let’s get started.
