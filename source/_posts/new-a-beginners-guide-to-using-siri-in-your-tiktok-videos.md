## Part 1: What is Siri Voice?

Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.

You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that's because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out **how to do Siri voice on TikTok** without any hassle in the next part!

## Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?

To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:

**Step 1:** Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.

**Step 2:** Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.

**Step 3:** Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.

**Step 4:** Now, begin writing something on the screen.

**Step 5:** Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.

## Part 3: Don't Like the Siri Voice on TikTok? Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps

If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let's throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok's text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.

But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin' accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.

If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.
