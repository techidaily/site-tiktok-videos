Whether you love it or hate it, you must have heard about an App in 2020 - TikTok.

The government fears it, but companies eager to make money off it. TikTok probably has been the most controversial (and prevalent) social network ever.

What makes TikTok different? Initially, Tiktok is famous for its 15-second short videos, and most of the videos are lip-syncing videos.
