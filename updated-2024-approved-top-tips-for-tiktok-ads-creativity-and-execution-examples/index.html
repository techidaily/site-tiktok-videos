<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?"></a>Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?</h2><p>We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p>
<p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"
                ></p>
<p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p>
<p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p>
<p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p>
<p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok top view ads"
                ></p>
<p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"
                ></p>
<p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p>
<p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p>
<p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p>
<p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok effects ads"
                ></p>
<p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p>

<h3 id="3-Guess"><a href="#3-Guess" class="headerlink" title="3. Guess"></a>3. Guess</h3><p><img

                      alt="guess"
                ></p>

<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?"></a>Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?</h2><p>We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p>
<p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"
                ></p>
<p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p>
<p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p>
<p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p>
<p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok top view ads"
                ></p>
<p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"
                ></p>
<p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p>
<p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p>
<p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p>
<p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg"
                      alt="tiktok effects ads"
                ></p>
<p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p>

<p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p>

                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"
                ></p>
<p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p>
<p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p>
<p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p>
<p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="tiktok top view ads"
                ></p>
<p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"
                ></p>
<p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p>
<p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p>
<p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p>
<p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="tiktok effects ads"
                ></p>
<p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p>
