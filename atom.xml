This trend started on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and has spread to other social media like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.</p><p>Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools"></a>How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools</h2><p>In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.</p><p>To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.</p><p>Adding Texts in TikTok Video with TikTok: By Rhia</p><p>Moreover, the app lets you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >control the video’s playback speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting.

Once you are done editing, you can proceed to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add the description of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos</h2><p>The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks.

However, their project of biddable ads is in progress. It will be launched soon after completion. What brands search for are different influencers either according to the niche or growth of a particular Tik Tok account. Nowadays, influencers have to contact brands for promotions or stuff like that. So, if you have more count on followers and engagement as an influencer, you would be going to get the right amount on those sponsorships.</p><p>The most important aspect is to calculate the engagement rate. It is because it’s a highly considerable factor brand may look. However, there is no official method to calculate the engagement rate. Most of the published ones are inaccurate. They won’t tell you the correct specs about the percentage of people opening the app once a day. For accuracy concerns, we’ve devised a formula to calculate individual Tik Tok account engagement. The formula states as [No. of hearts + No. of comments]&#x2F; No. of followers] × 100.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Calculates engagement rate</li><li>DIY method</li><li>Zero cost solution</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Not super effective</li></ul><h4 id="2-Igface"><a href="#2-Igface" class="headerlink" title="2.

Do you use the platform just to watch videos or do you upload your content too? If you said yes to the second part of the question then we are here to make your life easy. Users often spend needlessly extra time and energy when it comes to uploading edited videos on the mobile app of Tiktok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Editing the chosen video on your computer then transferring it to your phone and uploading it to the app is a long and tedious process.

When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.</p><p>The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.</p><ol><li><p>You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.</p></li><li><p>Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.</p></li><li><p>Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.</p></li><li><p>After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/cloud-icon.jpg"                                     ></p><ol start="5"><li><p>Once the video is uploaded, you will be asked to put in a caption. We advise you to keep the caption quirky and fun. Another quick tip is that you should use hashtags that are trending at the moment as that will increase the visual appearance of your video more.</p></li><li><p>Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.</p></li></ol><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Upload-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="Upload tiktok video"                ></p><ol start="7"><li><p>Lastly, choose the audience of the video according to your preference in the same window.</p></li><li><p>Your video is ready to be uploaded and all you need to do now is to click on the Upload button that is on the bottom right of the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Methods-of-Uploading-Videos-to-TikTok-on-Windows"><a href="#Methods-of-Uploading-Videos-to-TikTok-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows"></a>Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows</h2><p>As a person who does not own a Mac, you might be wondering if this article is for you or not.

There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.</p><p>If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video. This has to be engaging enough to attract more and more followers. The primary aim of an introduction video is to say high to your followers and tell them about yourself. With this video, they will get to know you better.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Upload a Video to TikTok from Mac or PC&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone"><a href="#Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text. Now, upload the videos, and that’s it.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee"><a href="#Likee" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world. It is a social platform for sharing short videos. As with Likee, it is the perfect tool for creating the most amazing multimedia content that you can think of.</p><p>Both these apps are used for creating and sharing short videos on social media and are compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. Each of these apps offers a range of attractions for their young users.</p><p>With people debating on whether to stick with TikTok or switch to Likee, are you confused about what sets apart these video-sharing apps from each other? Here’s a detailed comparison of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Likee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headquarters</td><td>China</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Type</td><td>TikTok is a PGC (Profession Generated Content) platform</td><td>Likee is a UGC (User Generated Content) platform</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Options</td><td>A multitude of video effects Emojis, text, frames, trimming videos, and much more</td><td>AI &amp; AR-based technology Realistic hair color filters, 4D magic, superpower effects</td></tr><tr><td>Music Options</td><td>Broad and up-to-date music catalog. Third-party apps are needed to add their own music</td><td>The built-in music library is fairly limited to TikTok. Allows users to add ‘local music’</td></tr><tr><td>Text Options</td><td>Text boxes with accurate timing and positioning. The background color is adjustable</td><td>Multiple text boxes with accurate timing. Ability to change the size, font, color, angle, and background</td></tr><tr><td>Socialization</td><td>TikTok aims to redefine digital socialization by introducing online video socialization</td><td>Likee allows user to watch live streaming and make new friends by People Nearby function</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users worldwide</td><td>150 million monthly active users</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok"><a href="#Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Will Likee Surpass TikTok?"></a>Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</h2><p>With the whole “TikTok being banned in the US” becoming a thing, some assumed that competitors will soon surpass TikTok. However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed. But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos. What makes TikTok so addictive is that the app enables users to express themselves through different creative ways.</p><h4 id="2-Native-Content-Editor"><a href="#2-Native-Content-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2.Native Content Editor"></a>2.Native Content Editor</h4><p>TikTok’s features to shoot footage, quickly trim and stitch together video clips and incorporate voice as well as music effects at the touch of a button makes it the ideal destination for every creator. When it comes to Likee vs. TikTok, what makes the trim feature of TikTok so enticing is that the app allows creators to storyboard their videos and publish their finished product.</p><h4 id="3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos"><a href="#3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos"></a>3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos</h4><p>The homepage of TikTok is much more like Twitter than Instagram or Facebook. This means that viral videos with great engagement move to the front of the line and comprise the feed. Although a “Discover” tab allows you to browse specific topics and hashtags, you are served with one video at a time.</p><p>This is a part of TikTok’s competitive advantage over Likee. With an endless number of prompts, it is easy to participate since you need not have anything interesting to talk about to get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-problem.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok Problem"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.theguardian.com/" >www.theguardian.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>No matter whether you are social media lurker or a content creator, be assured that TikTok is here to stay. Don’t believe us? Try Likee for yourself and you will soon realize that TikTok is unmatchable.

The process of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >cloning yourself in a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a simple one, but there are certain rules you have to follow while recording the footage that will help you avoid overlapping the figures you’re cloning. Here’s how you can make your first <strong>clone yourself video on TikTok</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clone-yourself-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Clone Yourself on TikTok"                ></p><h2 id="Selecting-the-Song-for-your-Clone-Video"><a href="#Selecting-the-Song-for-your-Clone-Video" class="headerlink" title="Selecting the Song for your Clone Video"></a>Selecting the Song for your Clone Video</h2><p>Before you start shooting the video you first need to select the song on <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id835599320?mt=8" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>you’re going to use in the video. Once you’ve found the perfect track simply record it and save it as a video to your camera roll. You can then import the video clip that contains the song into the <a class="link"   href="http://videostarapp.com/" >Video Star <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app.</p><p>Here are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 Popular TikTok Songs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-tiktok-songs.jpg"                      alt="Select TikTok Song"                ></p><h2 id="Using-the-Video-Star-App-to-Clone-Yourself"><a href="#Using-the-Video-Star-App-to-Clone-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Using the Video Star App to Clone Yourself"></a>Using the Video Star App to Clone Yourself</h2><h4 id="1-Download-Video-Star-App"><a href="#1-Download-Video-Star-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Download Video Star App"></a>1. Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star" class="headerlink" title="3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star"></a>3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star</h4><p>Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time. The Video Star app lets you create as many clones of yourself as you want, so you just have to make sure that your video clips can be easily combined to feature two or more of your clones and have fun exploring the effects that can make your videos look even cooler. If you want to be a success on the TikTok platform, learning how to make clone videos is one of the best ways to do it, so choose your favorite songs and start producing clone yourself videos.</p><p>You can also use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make a split-screen with ease.

Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming"><a href="#2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Your Profile Look Charming"></a>2. Make Your Profile Look Charming</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Charming Profile on TikTok"                ></p><p>Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn’t going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you’re producing fitness videos, it’s also helpful if you mention that you’re making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.</p><h4 id="3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges"><a href="#3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3. Participate in Viral Challenges"></a>3. Participate in Viral Challenges</h4><p>Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.</p><h4 id="4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks"><a href="#4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks"></a>4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks</h4><p>Don’t limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won’t be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn’t much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others"><a href="#5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others"></a>5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others</h4><p>Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn’t always pay off, especially if you’re just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you’re hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you’re going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok’s Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.</p><h4 id="6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos"><a href="#6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos"></a>6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos</h4><p>All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don’t have to use professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you’d like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >User Gallery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to empower video creation.</p><p>Free download Filmora now and make yourself a superstar on TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative"><a href="#7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Unique and Innovative"></a>7. Be Unique and Innovative</h4><p>Find your own voice, because everyone else’s voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you’ll never find your own distinctive style. What’s more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you’re really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you’re passionate about because if you’re just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don’t be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you’ll discover something your fans adore, and you’ll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise"><a href="#8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep Things Short and Concise"></a>8. Keep Things Short and Concise</h4><p>It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone’s camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.</p><h4 id="9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One"><a href="#9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One" class="headerlink" title="9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One"></a>9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Entertainer on TikTok"                ></p><p>How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don’t have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you’re going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.</p><h4 id="10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours"><a href="#10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours" class="headerlink" title="10. Post New Content At Magic Hours"></a>10. Post New Content At Magic Hours</h4><p>Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they’re using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Reviving-Classics-Top-20-Anime-Concepts-for-TikToks"><a href="#Reviving-Classics-Top-20-Anime-Concepts-for-TikToks" class="headerlink" title="Reviving Classics: Top 20 Anime Concepts for TikToks"></a>Reviving Classics: Top 20 Anime Concepts for TikToks</h2><p>TikTok has become an unstoppable source of entertainment. Memes and videos are appealing to watch, although better ones are released virtually every day for inspiration. numerous musicians included as they acquire recognition. Their tunes and hits delighted viewers, and songs earned prominence. Most individuals obtained followers via popular videos that were often featured on the subscribers’ lists. Get inspired by the newest <strong>anime TikTok</strong> trends and discover how to spot upcoming trends to boost your company or personal account.</p><p>Something that appears perennially groovy one moment might be insufferable the next — like, say, wearing fedoras or Kreepa’s <strong>anime TikTok</strong> “Oh No.” Every second, new trend is forming, and old ones are fading. It’s the cycle of life. If you’re seeking inspiration, read on: we’ve put up a guide to the finest TikTok trends of 2022. So how can we stay up with the current TikTok trends? How do we remain hip? A TikTok trend might be music, hashtag, dance, or challenge. Even how you modify your <strong>TikTok anime</strong> might become a trend like a fancy transition style. Once a <strong>TikTok anime</strong> trend begins to gather hold, people “hop on” it by duplicating a current TikTok video or theme.</p><h2 id="Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea"><a href="#Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea"></a>Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea</h2><p>Brace yourself for the upcoming listicle. It contains all about TikTok Anime ideas; dances, songs, memes, and filters. Let’s find out one-by-one:</p><h3 id="Let’s-Groove"><a href="#Let’s-Groove" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Groove:"></a>Let’s Groove:</h3><p>This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind &amp; Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.</p><h3 id="Trending-dances"><a href="#Trending-dances" class="headerlink" title="Trending dances:"></a>Trending dances:</h3><p>TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p><h3 id="Prada-Bucket-challenge"><a href="#Prada-Bucket-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Prada Bucket challenge:"></a>Prada Bucket challenge:</h3><p>This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.</p><h3 id="Glow-ups"><a href="#Glow-ups" class="headerlink" title="Glow-ups:"></a>Glow-ups:</h3><p>At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.</p><h3 id="Anime-Edits"><a href="#Anime-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Anime Edits:"></a>Anime Edits:</h3><p>If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.</p><h3 id="Edgy-humor"><a href="#Edgy-humor" class="headerlink" title="Edgy humor:"></a>Edgy humor:</h3><p>There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.</p><h3 id="Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family"><a href="#Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family" class="headerlink" title="Making TikToks with Your Family:"></a>Making TikToks with Your Family:</h3><p>This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.</p><h3 id="Baked-Feta-Pasta"><a href="#Baked-Feta-Pasta" class="headerlink" title="Baked Feta Pasta:"></a>Baked Feta Pasta:</h3><p>This is a TikTok trend for all those foodies out there who enjoy delicious spaghetti with some cheese. This practice grew so prevalent that the grocery shops in Finland faced a scarcity of feta cheese. The technique of creating this pasta is straightforward, start by adding some cherry tomatoes and garlic in an oven-safe dish, sprinkle some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and pour some olive oil before combining the ingredients. Place a block of Feta cheese in the middle and bake in the oven until soft, compress the contents to make a paste, and combine with your favorite Pasta, that’s it! Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.</p><h3 id="Seamless-Transitions"><a href="#Seamless-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Seamless Transitions:"></a>Seamless Transitions:</h3><p>Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.</p><h3 id="Pet-Painting"><a href="#Pet-Painting" class="headerlink" title="Pet Painting:"></a>Pet Painting:</h3><p>This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to have your fuzzy companion included in one of your videos. No, you don’t paint a portrait of your pet, your pet performs the painting portion, how you may ask? it’s fairly easy, all you need is a canvas, some liquid colors of your choosing, a huge plastic bag, and a pet, of course, you will also need a paste-like food that your pet enjoys, peanut butter for instance. Start by covering the canvas with the plastic bag and spread peanut butter on the section covering the canvas, gently remove the canvas from the bag and keep the plastic aside.</p><h3 id="Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture"><a href="#Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Referencing Modern Pop Culture:"></a>Referencing Modern Pop Culture:</h3><p>Score some likes, comments, and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan following. Trending TV series and movies frequently inspire their TikTok trends. When Squid Game dominated the globe in 2021, it prompted suspense-making instructions, musical mashups, and many tracksuits. This is just one of the millions of instances of how inventive TikTok fans addressed the program.</p><h3 id="Satisfying-Videos"><a href="#Satisfying-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Satisfying Videos:"></a>Satisfying Videos:</h3><p>This simply possibly be the most widely accepted and least contentious genre ever: the enjoyable video. Like the day-in-the-life films, they are a celebration of the commonplace. So, the likelihood is, you’re already doing something pleasurable to watch. Whether its soap cutting or cake frosting or freezing bubbles, there’s something very relaxing and fulfilling about this type of material.</p><h3 id="Passing-the-Phone"><a href="#Passing-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Passing the Phone:"></a>Passing the Phone:</h3><p>We’re going to top things off with another TikTok trend, this one is a fun way of roasting your friends or family members and, of course, getting them involved in your TikToks. The way these trend works is really simple, you just call out your friend by making funny comments about certain bad habits or characteristics they have and then pass the phone to them because it’s their turn to do the same, so it’s just a series of taking turns roasting your friends and the best part is that there is no limit to how many people can participate.</p><h3 id="Challenge-Freezing-Honey"><a href="#Challenge-Freezing-Honey" class="headerlink" title="Challenge: Freezing Honey"></a>Challenge: Freezing Honey</h3><p>Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it’s safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.</p><h3 id="Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life"><a href="#Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life" class="headerlink" title="Documenting a Day in The Life:"></a>Documenting a Day in The Life:</h3><p>While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that “no one wants to see your avocado toast,” the truth is that a lot of people do. Many of these films romanticize the mundane, but humor has a place in this medium as well. If you’re a creative who gets a lot of questions in the comments section, here is the place to be. Seeing someone’s daily routine, whether it’s a second-grade teacher, a lawyer, or a couple living in a van, is a rewarding experience. Over 2 million people have liked this “actual day in the life of a vehicle.”</p><h3 id="Classical-Challenges"><a href="#Classical-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Classical Challenges:"></a>Classical Challenges:</h3><p>TikTok thrives on obstacles. For challenges, many TikTok users would all post films aiming to achieve the same thing, like the stair-step challenge, where they would dance up a set of steps in intricate ways. These are generally community-created trends; however, they may take the shape of sponsored hashtags, too. Challenges are a simple way for users on TikTok to feel like they’re part of the community.</p><h3 id="Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me"><a href="#Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me" class="headerlink" title="Tell Me Without Telling Me:"></a>Tell Me Without Telling Me:</h3><p>The creator begins by saying, “Tell me you drive a fast car without telling me you drive a fast car” and then says, “I’ll go first” to start a streak for other users to follow. Users then proceed to show the engine layout of their vehicle, the exhaust note, or possibly a flyby, so following this trend is a good way to make your TikToks stand out. This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to tell your audience what you’re trying to say or to depict certain occurrences subtly.</p><h3 id="Behind-the-scenes-Videos"><a href="#Behind-the-scenes-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Behind-the-scenes Videos:"></a>Behind-the-scenes Videos:</h3><p>We love an inside scoop, and behind-the-scenes films are perfect for teaching and for making viewers feel like they’re receiving something special. If you’re a creative who generates something tangible (like art, cuisine, or fashion) and advertises it on TikTok, a behind-the-scenes film might give your brand an added depth. You can even produce a behind-the-scenes TikTok describing how you made a TikTok. Ontario, California-based Logan’s candies attracted five and a half million followers by releasing TikToks depicting how their sweets were made—it’s a very interesting process.</p><h3 id="Love-Nwantiti-Dance"><a href="#Love-Nwantiti-Dance" class="headerlink" title="Love Nwantiti Dance:"></a>Love Nwantiti Dance:</h3><p>The Love Nwantiti Dance is a dance that is performed by people who love one another. If you like dancing and music, you may try filming a TikTok dance video to capitalize on this trend. Love Nwantiti is a song by CKay, a Nigerian singer and songwriter who goes by the alias “CKay.” The phrase “Nwantiti” means “little love” in Igbo. This is one of those TikTok trends where content producers flash their skills by dancing to hot music or songs, in this instance a tune named “Love Nwantiti.” It is more popular with young people.</p><h3 id="Hashtags-with-Challenges"><a href="#Hashtags-with-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Hashtags with Challenges:"></a>Hashtags with Challenges:</h3><p>Many videos will frequently add a #ForYou hashtag to be featured on the page. Just like any other app, getting to the main page is key to landing a popular TikTok video and collecting new followers. Considering TikTok is starting to look at advertising directly in the app, revenue for TikTokers isn’t far off, and leveraging hashtags to trick the system is important to gaining viewers. TikTok virtually runs on hashtags. It’s what makes the app so entertaining. Everything is shared, and everyone is encouraged to join in. Clicking on hashtags, particularly ones that are developed around challenges, is a simple method to find what others are using to get to the ‘For You’ area.</p><h3 id="Learn-on-TikTok"><a href="#Learn-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Learn on TikTok:"></a>Learn on TikTok:</h3><p>This TikTok trend is a spectacular method for creators to share their ideas, talents, and life hacks and a chance for viewers to expand their knowledge on particular subjects and discover new items that may aid them in their day-to-day lives. The greatest part is that this trend is for everyone since the number of concepts that may be inferred here is practically never-ending, there might be someone excellent at cooking, someone, whose fighting abilities are good, someone who’s strong at arithmetic, or maybe someone who’s good at mending automobiles.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>From ramping up your posting schedule to taking part in challenges, and optimizing your hashtags, the inventive methods to get followers and develop a TikTok community are numerous. Regardless, if you find <strong>anime TikTok</strong> cringeworthy and strange, that’s probably because you grew up in the period before the social web. Generation Z’s enjoy the funny internet sharing platform and many now earn money from it. It’s easy, hilarious, and irreverent - and a pleasant change of pace from more serious networks such as Twitter and Facebook. It’s the perfect procrastination app that can lure you in for hours. Ultimately, the greatest strategy to expand your following will come down to your ingenuity, so don’t hold back and start experimenting with the <strong>TikTok anime</strong> videos you’ve always wanted to do.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Speedy-TikTok-Video-Creation-A-Comprehensible-Guide"><a href="#Speedy-TikTok-Video-Creation-A-Comprehensible-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Speedy TikTok Video Creation: A Comprehensible Guide"></a>Speedy TikTok Video Creation: A Comprehensible Guide</h2><p>Recording or uploading a TikTok video at 2X or 3X speed is even made simpler by third-party video editing tools like Kapwing and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text. Now, upload the videos, and that’s it.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps"></a>Part 3: Don’t Like the Siri Voice on TikTok? Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

A simple way out is to use software-based simulation, which means replacing the video background with the required one rather than the original. After reading the article, we hope that you don’t have any concerns about how to change the TikTok video background.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><h5 id="Edit-TikTok-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-TikTok-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit TikTok Videos with Filmora"></a>Edit TikTok Videos with Filmora</h5><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the best video editors to level up your TikTok video with stunning effects.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-transforming-text-into-voice-for-tiktok-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] Transforming Text Into Voice for TikTok Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tiktok-edits-unleashed-crafting-engaging-video-reactions-with-filmoras-pro-mode/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  TikTok Edits Unleashed  Crafting Engaging Video Reactions with Filmora's Pro Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/the-casual-entrants-handbook-for-tiktok-lives/"><u>The Casual Entrant's Handbook for TikTok Lives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pro-tips-for-precise-and-popular-tiktok-reactions-in-filmora/"><u>2024 Approved  Pro Tips for Precise and Popular TikTok Reactions in Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-revolutionize-your-tiktok-experience-the-complete-audio-customization-handbook/"><u>[New] In 2024, Revolutionize Your TikTok Experience  The Complete Audio Customization Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-trending-beats-and-basic-tiktok-steps/"><u>In 2024, Trending Beats and Basic TikTok Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-secrets-for-snatching-unmarked-tiktok-content-on-iphones/"><u>In 2024, Secrets for Snatching Unmarked TikTok Content on iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-any-vivo-v27-pro-phone-password-using-emergency-call-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Unlock Any Vivo V27 Pro Phone Password Using Emergency Call</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-choice-top-12-non-time-restricted-recorders/"><u>2024 Approved  Expert Choice  Top 12 Non-Time Restricted Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/navigate-the-quickest-growing-yt-havens-for-mental-brightness-for-2024/"><u>Navigate the Quickest-Growing YT Havens for Mental Brightness for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/from-overflowed-drafters-to-ordered-files-learn-to-edit-hefty-tiktok-content/"><u>From Overflowed Drafters to Ordered Files  Learn to Edit Hefty TikTok Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-innovative-online-solutions-for-acoustic-purification/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Innovative Online Solutions for Acoustic Purification</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-or-bypass-knox-enrollment-service-on-vivo-y100i-power-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Remove or Bypass Knox Enrollment Service On Vivo Y100i Power 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/the-comprehensive-guide-to-adjusting-siris-voice-in-ios-devices-for-2024/"><u>The Comprehensive Guide to Adjusting Siris Voice in iOS Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-skyrocket-your-marketing-game-on-reddit-proven-success-techniques/"><u>[Updated] Skyrocket Your Marketing Game on Reddit  Proven Success Techniques</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

When we talk about ease of use, we refer to the option of directly uploading a video on your TikTok profile from Mac.</p><p>The best thing about TikTok on Mac is that it has made it fairly easy for anyone to use their platform. If you want to upload a video to TikTok on Mac OS you will find it a child’s play. TikTok has a website version of the platform for people to use if they are on their computer.</p><ol><li><p>You should choose a video that has already been editing by video editing software as the website will not allow you to make any edits. We always emphasize using only the best video editor for Mac.</p></li><li><p>Go to Safari and search for the website of TikTok.</p></li><li><p>Once you are on there, you will need to Log in to your account by clicking on the button that appears on the top right corner of the window.</p></li><li><p>After you are in, you need to locate and click on the Cloud icon which will open a window for you to upload your video.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/cloud-icon.jpg"                                     ></p><ol start="5"><li><p>Once the video is uploaded, you will be asked to put in a caption. We advise you to keep the caption quirky and fun. Another quick tip is that you should use hashtags that are trending at the moment as that will increase the visual appearance of your video more.</p></li><li><p>Time to choose a cover! Drag the frame to any part of the video to choose the thumbnail that you want as the cover of your content.</p></li></ol><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Upload-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="Upload tiktok video"                ></p><ol start="7"><li><p>Lastly, choose the audience of the video according to your preference in the same window.</p></li><li><p>Your video is ready to be uploaded and all you need to do now is to click on the Upload button that is on the bottom right of the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Methods-of-Uploading-Videos-to-TikTok-on-Windows"><a href="#Methods-of-Uploading-Videos-to-TikTok-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows"></a>Methods of Uploading Videos to TikTok on Windows</h2><p>As a person who does not own a Mac, you might be wondering if this article is for you or not.
