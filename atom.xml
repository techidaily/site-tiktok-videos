Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community.

If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-2"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space.

Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-3"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok-3"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-3"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-3" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content-3"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime-3"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime-3" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content-3"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More-3"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More-3" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility.

You look at videos with millions of views and wonder what it is that they are doing and you are not?</p><p>Well, let me tell you a secret!</p><p>While the content of the video is the most important thing when it comes to getting views, certain factors contribute to grabbing the attention of the audience. This includes the caption and the cover of your video.</p><p>So, if you’re out to make the next big viral video, you’ll need to work a bit on creating a compelling video with a nice caption and an attractive cover.</p><p>And that’s why we have compiled a complete guide for Tiktok elements!</p><h2 id="Tiktok-Videos"><a href="#Tiktok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Tiktok Videos"></a><strong>Tiktok Videos</strong></h2><p>So, what is it that you need to make a successful Tiktok video? Let’s have a look:</p><h3 id="1-Tiktok-Video-Requirements"><a href="#1-Tiktok-Video-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="1. Tiktok Video Requirements"></a><strong>1. Tiktok Video Requirements</strong></h3><p>The first and most important thing that you need to know and understand is the requirement of a Tiktok video. The aspect ratio, the dimension, the orientation, and of course, the length!</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> The majority of the people use Tiktok on their smartphones, so the aspect ratio for a Tiktok video should be 9:16 or 1:1 if there are sidebars.</p><p><strong>Dimension:</strong> The recommended dimension for a Tiktok video is 1080 x 1920.</p><p><strong>Video Orientation:</strong> As mentioned earlier, users usually watch Tiktok videos on their smartphones, so a video with a vertical orientation is much easier to watch compared to a video in landscape mode for which one has to tilt their phones.</p><p><strong>Video Length:</strong> Tiktok videos are usually 15 to 60 seconds long depending on the content, but my advice would be to keep them short, as people usually watch shorter videos till the end and might get bored if the video is too long.</p><p><strong>Video File Size:</strong> The file size for iOS devices is 287.6 MB max, and for Android, it is 72 MB.</p><p><strong>Supported Format:</strong> The video format compatible with Tiktok is MP4 and MOV.</p><p>If you keep these basic requirements in mind and make videos that fall within these criteria, I’m sure your videos will be watch-worthy. However, there are other elements to consider as well, like…</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-Successful-Tiktok-Videos"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-Successful-Tiktok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.

Best Practices to Make Successful Tiktok Videos</strong></h3><p>Tiktok video requirements will help you create videos with the perfect orientation, dimension, and aspect ratio. However, if you want to make videos that get millions of views, go viral, and increase your followers, you must know the best practices to make successful Tiktok videos.</p><p>For instance:</p><p><strong>Post Frequently:</strong> If you want to appear on the FYP, you must post often! The more videos you post, the more the chances to come in front of the audience. And, when the audience sees you regularly, they will get acquainted and start following you to see more of your content.</p><p><strong>Follow the Trends:</strong> Tiktok is all about trends. Something goes viral, and everyone starts making the same content to jump on the bandwagon. The trick is to make the same thing in a unique way. Therefore…</p><p><strong>Be Authentic:</strong> The only way you can be unique is to be authentic, be you! If you keep your originality intact even when following the trend, chances are the audience might just click with your content.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche:</strong> While, Tiktok is known for having all sorts of video content, ranging from comedy, to sad, to just being motivational, you need to find something you’re good at. For instance, if you can sing well, you can post videos of you singing famous songs. Or, if you can paint well, you can post videos of you painting something. You will reach the right audience, and they will follow you!</p><p>If you ask me, I could watch ASMR cooking videos for hours!</p><h2 id="3-Methods-to-Find-a-Viral-Titok-Topic"><a href="#3-Methods-to-Find-a-Viral-Titok-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3.

Here are a few examples:</p><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> One way to create a viral video is to go for social media challenges. People come up with challenge videos every now and then, and the whole world gets into the groove, like that ice bucket challenge from 2014 or the Cotton Eyed Joe challenge from 2021.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKavSXN/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKavSXN/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Dance Videos:</strong> Social media challenges are one thing, but viral dance videos take the fun to the next level. So, if you think you can dance, and add a bit of creativity to it, make a dance challenge video. If you’re good at it, you’ll definitely gain some followers.</p><p><strong>Lip Sync Videos:</strong> Another way to go viral on Tiktok is to make lip-sync videos. The trick is to see who can do it without messing up the lyrics. Like this viral song “Already Best Friends” by Sagittarius Kween:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKanPpe/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKanPpe/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Art Videos:</strong> If you can make art, you can go viral in no time! Take out those paints, colors, and pens, and create a time-lapse painting! Something like this:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Satisfying ASMR Videos:</strong> Satisfying ASMR videos are getting increasingly popular.

Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions"></a><strong>1. Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions</strong></h3><p>Here are some tips to help your videos go viral due to the captions:</p><p><strong>Quotes:</strong> A caption can be any line that describes the video or a quote just to grab attention. You can use famous quotes or a dialogue that’s trending to make your caption attractive.</p><p><strong>Hashtags:</strong> You can also use viral hashtags in your captions to make your video appear on the FYP or if someone searches for that particular hashtag. Another tip is to use generic hashtags alongside the viral ones, like #Art #Funny #Asmr, etc.</p><p><strong>Mentions:</strong> Mentioning famous Tiktok accounts in your caption can also make people watch your video.</p><p><strong>Emojis:</strong> Using emojis in the caption is a good idea to grab attention and make it worth reading.</p><p>We’re done with how to make watch-worthy Tiktok videos and add engaging captions. But did you know that the video cover also plays an essential role in getting more views?</p><h2 id="Tiktok-Video-Cover"><a href="#Tiktok-Video-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Tiktok Video Cover"></a><strong>Tiktok Video Cover</strong></h2><p>Like influencers use catchy thumbnails for their YouTube videos; similarly, TikTok videos also have video covers.

Requirements for TikTok Video Cover"></a><strong>1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover</strong></h3><p>A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not. Therefore, when choosing a cover for your video, make sure it:</p><ul><li>Accurately portrays the content</li><li>Creates excitement among the audience</li><li>Catches their attention</li></ul><p>If you succeed in doing these 3 things, the audience will be definitely compelled to click on your video!</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover" class="headerlink" title="2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover"></a><strong>2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover</strong></h3><p>If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Include Text:</strong> A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.</p><p>For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.</p><p>Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.</p><p><strong>Use a Good Font Style:</strong> I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.</p><p>Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.</p><p>So, choose your font wisely!</p><p><strong>Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:</strong> Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Add Few Objects Only:</strong> Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.</p><p>With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!</p><h2 id="3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover"><a href="#3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover" class="headerlink" title="3.

The trick is to see who can do it without messing up the lyrics.

Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions</strong></h3><p>Here are some tips to help your videos go viral due to the captions:</p><p><strong>Quotes:</strong> A caption can be any line that describes the video or a quote just to grab attention. You can use famous quotes or a dialogue that’s trending to make your caption attractive.</p><p><strong>Hashtags:</strong> You can also use viral hashtags in your captions to make your video appear on the FYP or if someone searches for that particular hashtag. Another tip is to use generic hashtags alongside the viral ones, like #Art #Funny #Asmr, etc.</p><p><strong>Mentions:</strong> Mentioning famous Tiktok accounts in your caption can also make people watch your video.</p><p><strong>Emojis:</strong> Using emojis in the caption is a good idea to grab attention and make it worth reading.</p><p>We’re done with how to make watch-worthy Tiktok videos and add engaging captions.

Requirements for TikTok Video Cover"></a><strong>1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover</strong></h3><p>A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not. Therefore, when choosing a cover for your video, make sure it:</p><ul><li>Accurately portrays the content</li><li>Creates excitement among the audience</li><li>Catches their attention</li></ul><p>If you succeed in doing these 3 things, the audience will be definitely compelled to click on your video!</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover-2"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover"></a><strong>2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover</strong></h3><p>If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Include Text:</strong> A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.</p><p>For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.</p><p>Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.</p><p><strong>Use a Good Font Style:</strong> I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.</p><p>Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.</p><p>So, choose your font wisely!</p><p><strong>Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:</strong> Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Add Few Objects Only:</strong> Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look.

The effects under the <strong>Filter</strong> effects section will be immediately activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-special-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok special effects option"                ></p><p>Step 2: To use this feature, you must browse the Time Effects part of the effects section. To do so, choose “<strong>Time effects</strong>“ from the drop-down menu in the bottom right corner of the screen, as shown by the arrow in the image below. It will provide you with different temporal effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-time-effects-option.jpg"                      alt="tiktok time effects option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> It is necessary to choose the <strong>Slow Motion</strong> option from the list of alternatives that appears, as shown in the figure below. This will give the video the appearance of being in slow motion.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Changing the length of the slow-motion is accomplished by dragging the green square that appears on the screen. <strong>Drag it</strong> to any portion of the page where you want the slow-motion effect to appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-slow-motion-effect.jpg"                      alt="tiktok slow motion effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’re pleased with the effect, you may save it by selecting the save option from the menu. As seen in the illustration below, click on “<strong>Save</strong>“ will save your work.</p><p><strong>(Note</strong>: You will be returned to the previous screen if you do so. After that, you may edit it with whatever filters you want and publish it just like any other video).</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Slow-Down-Tik-Tok-Videos-Online-for-Free-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Slow-Down-Tik-Tok-Videos-Online-for-Free-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?"></a>Part 3: How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?</h2><h3 id="Kapwing-3"><a href="#Kapwing-3" class="headerlink" title="Kapwing"></a>Kapwing</h3><p>In a couple of seconds, Kapwing can speed up and slow down short videos. Slo-mo, timelapse, and hyperspeed films may be made with no editing skills then shared on social networking websites like YouTube.</p><p>Get started by uploading a video or pasting a URL. AVI, MP4, MOV, and 3PG are all supported formats by Kapwing. As slow as 0.25x for a slow-motion movie and as much as 4x for an enhanced video are available. Let’s give you a step-by-step illustration:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On TikTok, find the video you want to slow down and click on. You have the option of slowing down videos from other people’s profiles and those from your profile. <strong>Copy the URL</strong> that appears when you click the <strong>Share</strong> button.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This is where Kapwing comes in, and we utilize it on our PC using Chrome to accomplish our objective. Visit <a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >https://www.kapwing.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and copy the URL of the TikTok video and paste it into Kapwing.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Speed section, and use the – and + buttons to make the video slow down or speed up. After selecting “<strong>slow-motion</strong>“ as your preferred speed, press the “<strong>play</strong>“ button to begin watching the movie. If the video moves too slowly, click on the <strong>Plus</strong> sign and keep rewatching it until you’re satisfied with the pace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-slow-motion-effect-kapwing-online.jpg"                      alt="add slow motion effect kapwing online"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This step is optional, but it comes in useful if you’re performing in a duet or if you want to watch a TikTok video while you’re not connected to the internet. Following your completion of the speed adjustment, go to the top of the studio and click <strong>Export</strong> <strong>Video</strong>. After your video has been processed, you may save it to your device by clicking the <strong>Download</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-or-share-looping-video-interface-kapwing.jpg"                      alt="download or share looping video interface kapwing"                ></p><p><em>For more detail, you can check this article:</em> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>How to make a slo-mo video with Kapwing</em></a><em>?</em></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Slow-TikTok-Video-And-Song-Using-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Slow-TikTok-Video-And-Song-Using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to Slow TikTok Video And Song Using Filmora?</h2><p>In principle, TikTok can meet the majority of users’ video creation, editing, and sharing requirements.

Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee"><a href="#Likee" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity.

Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok-3"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee-3"><a href="#Likee-3" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok-3"><a href="#TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic.

The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences-3"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences-3" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world.

However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive-3"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive-3" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Bringing-Favorite-Manga-Characters-to-Life-in-TikTok"><a href="#Bringing-Favorite-Manga-Characters-to-Life-in-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Bringing Favorite Manga Characters to Life in TikTok"></a>Bringing Favorite Manga Characters to Life in TikTok</h2><p>TikTok has become an unstoppable source of entertainment. Memes and videos are appealing to watch, although better ones are released virtually every day for inspiration. numerous musicians included as they acquire recognition. Their tunes and hits delighted viewers, and songs earned prominence. Most individuals obtained followers via popular videos that were often featured on the subscribers’ lists. Get inspired by the newest <strong>anime TikTok</strong> trends and discover how to spot upcoming trends to boost your company or personal account.</p><p>Something that appears perennially groovy one moment might be insufferable the next — like, say, wearing fedoras or Kreepa’s <strong>anime TikTok</strong> “Oh No.” Every second, new trend is forming, and old ones are fading. It’s the cycle of life. If you’re seeking inspiration, read on: we’ve put up a guide to the finest TikTok trends of 2022. So how can we stay up with the current TikTok trends? How do we remain hip? A TikTok trend might be music, hashtag, dance, or challenge. Even how you modify your <strong>TikTok anime</strong> might become a trend like a fancy transition style. Once a <strong>TikTok anime</strong> trend begins to gather hold, people “hop on” it by duplicating a current TikTok video or theme.</p><h2 id="Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea"><a href="#Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea"></a>Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea</h2><p>Brace yourself for the upcoming listicle. It contains all about TikTok Anime ideas; dances, songs, memes, and filters. Let’s find out one-by-one:</p><h3 id="Let’s-Groove"><a href="#Let’s-Groove" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Groove:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/lets-groove-jojo" >Let’s Groove: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind &amp; Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.</p><h3 id="Trending-dances"><a href="#Trending-dances" class="headerlink" title="Trending dances:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-dance?lang=en" >Trending dances: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p><h3 id="Prada-Bucket-challenge"><a href="#Prada-Bucket-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Prada Bucket challenge:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/prada-challenge?lang=en" >Prada Bucket challenge: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.</p><h3 id="Glow-ups"><a href="#Glow-ups" class="headerlink" title="Glow-ups:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/biggest-anime-glow-ups?lang=en" >Glow-ups: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.</p><h3 id="Anime-Edits"><a href="#Anime-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Anime Edits:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/edits-anime?lang=en" >Anime Edits: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.</p><h3 id="Edgy-humor"><a href="#Edgy-humor" class="headerlink" title="Edgy humor:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/edgy-humor" >Edgy humor: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.</p><h3 id="Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family"><a href="#Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family" class="headerlink" title="Making TikToks with Your Family:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Making-an-anime-family" >Making TikToks with Your Family: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.</p><h3 id="Baked-Feta-Pasta"><a href="#Baked-Feta-Pasta" class="headerlink" title="Baked Feta Pasta:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Baked-Feta-Pasta" >Baked Feta Pasta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is a TikTok trend for all those foodies out there who enjoy delicious spaghetti with some cheese. This practice grew so prevalent that the grocery shops in Finland faced a scarcity of feta cheese. The technique of creating this pasta is straightforward, start by adding some cherry tomatoes and garlic in an oven-safe dish, sprinkle some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and pour some olive oil before combining the ingredients. Place a block of Feta cheese in the middle and bake in the oven until soft, compress the contents to make a paste, and combine with your favorite Pasta, that’s it! Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.</p><h3 id="Seamless-Transitions"><a href="#Seamless-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Seamless Transitions:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-smooth-transitions" >Seamless Transitions: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.</p><h3 id="Pet-Painting"><a href="#Pet-Painting" class="headerlink" title="Pet Painting:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/pet-painting?lang=en" >Pet Painting: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to have your fuzzy companion included in one of your videos. No, you don’t paint a portrait of your pet, your pet performs the painting portion, how you may ask? it’s fairly easy, all you need is a canvas, some liquid colors of your choosing, a huge plastic bag, and a pet, of course, you will also need a paste-like food that your pet enjoys, peanut butter for instance. Start by covering the canvas with the plastic bag and spread peanut butter on the section covering the canvas, gently remove the canvas from the bag and keep the plastic aside.</p><h3 id="Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture"><a href="#Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Referencing Modern Pop Culture:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-references?lang=en" >Referencing Modern Pop Culture: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Score some likes, comments, and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan following. Trending TV series and movies frequently inspire their TikTok trends. When Squid Game dominated the globe in 2021, it prompted suspense-making instructions, musical mashups, and many tracksuits. This is just one of the millions of instances of how inventive TikTok fans addressed the program.</p><h3 id="Satisfying-Videos"><a href="#Satisfying-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Satisfying Videos:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/satisfying-anime-cooking?lang=en" >Satisfying Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This simply possibly be the most widely accepted and least contentious genre ever: the enjoyable video. Like the day-in-the-life films, they are a celebration of the commonplace. So, the likelihood is, you’re already doing something pleasurable to watch. Whether its soap cutting or cake frosting or freezing bubbles, there’s something very relaxing and fulfilling about this type of material.</p><h3 id="Passing-the-Phone"><a href="#Passing-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Passing the Phone:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/pass-the-phone-challenge?lang=en" >Passing the Phone: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We’re going to top things off with another TikTok trend, this one is a fun way of roasting your friends or family members and, of course, getting them involved in your TikToks. The way these trend works is really simple, you just call out your friend by making funny comments about certain bad habits or characteristics they have and then pass the phone to them because it’s their turn to do the same, so it’s just a series of taking turns roasting your friends and the best part is that there is no limit to how many people can participate.</p><h3 id="Challenge-Freezing-Honey"><a href="#Challenge-Freezing-Honey" class="headerlink" title="Challenge: Freezing Honey"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Frozen-honey?lang=en" >Challenge: Freezing Honey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it’s safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.</p><h3 id="Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life"><a href="#Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life" class="headerlink" title="Documenting a Day in The Life:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Documenting-Life" >Documenting a Day in The Life: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that “no one wants to see your avocado toast,” the truth is that a lot of people do. Many of these films romanticize the mundane, but humor has a place in this medium as well. If you’re a creative who gets a lot of questions in the comments section, here is the place to be. Seeing someone’s daily routine, whether it’s a second-grade teacher, a lawyer, or a couple living in a van, is a rewarding experience. Over 2 million people have liked this “actual day in the life of a vehicle.”</p><h3 id="Classical-Challenges"><a href="#Classical-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Classical Challenges:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-tiktok-challenge?lang=en" >Classical Challenges: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>TikTok thrives on obstacles. For challenges, many TikTok users would all post films aiming to achieve the same thing, like the stair-step challenge, where they would dance up a set of steps in intricate ways. These are generally community-created trends; however, they may take the shape of sponsored hashtags, too. Challenges are a simple way for users on TikTok to feel like they’re part of the community.</p><h3 id="Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me"><a href="#Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me" class="headerlink" title="Tell Me Without Telling Me:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tellmewithouttellingme?lang=en" >Tell Me Without Telling Me: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The creator begins by saying, “Tell me you drive a fast car without telling me you drive a fast car” and then says, “I’ll go first” to start a streak for other users to follow. Users then proceed to show the engine layout of their vehicle, the exhaust note, or possibly a flyby, so following this trend is a good way to make your TikToks stand out. This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to tell your audience what you’re trying to say or to depict certain occurrences subtly.</p><h3 id="Behind-the-scenes-Videos"><a href="#Behind-the-scenes-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Behind-the-scenes Videos:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/behind-the-scenes-naruto" >Behind-the-scenes Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We love an inside scoop, and behind-the-scenes films are perfect for teaching and for making viewers feel like they’re receiving something special. If you’re a creative who generates something tangible (like art, cuisine, or fashion) and advertises it on TikTok, a behind-the-scenes film might give your brand an added depth. You can even produce a behind-the-scenes TikTok describing how you made a TikTok. Ontario, California-based Logan’s candies attracted five and a half million followers by releasing TikToks depicting how their sweets were made—it’s a very interesting process.</p><h3 id="Love-Nwantiti-Dance"><a href="#Love-Nwantiti-Dance" class="headerlink" title="Love Nwantiti Dance:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/nwantiti-anime?lang=en" >Love Nwantiti Dance: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Love Nwantiti Dance is a dance that is performed by people who love one another.

Love Nwantiti is a song by CKay, a Nigerian singer and songwriter who goes by the alias “CKay.” The phrase “Nwantiti” means “little love” in Igbo. This is one of those TikTok trends where content producers flash their skills by dancing to hot music or songs, in this instance a tune named “Love Nwantiti.” It is more popular with young people.</p><h3 id="Hashtags-with-Challenges"><a href="#Hashtags-with-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Hashtags with Challenges:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-challenge?lang=en" >Hashtags with Challenges: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Many videos will frequently add a #ForYou hashtag to be featured on the page. Just like any other app, getting to the main page is key to landing a popular TikTok video and collecting new followers. Considering TikTok is starting to look at advertising directly in the app, revenue for TikTokers isn’t far off, and leveraging hashtags to trick the system is important to gaining viewers. TikTok virtually runs on hashtags. It’s what makes the app so entertaining. Everything is shared, and everyone is encouraged to join in. Clicking on hashtags, particularly ones that are developed around challenges, is a simple method to find what others are using to get to the ‘For You’ area.</p><h3 id="Learn-on-TikTok"><a href="#Learn-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Learn on TikTok:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/learn-the-alphabet-with-anime?lang=en" >Learn on TikTok: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This TikTok trend is a spectacular method for creators to share their ideas, talents, and life hacks and a chance for viewers to expand their knowledge on particular subjects and discover new items that may aid them in their day-to-day lives.

Regardless, if you find <strong>anime TikTok</strong> cringeworthy and strange, that’s probably because you grew up in the period before the social web. Generation Z’s enjoy the funny internet sharing platform and many now earn money from it. It’s easy, hilarious, and irreverent - and a pleasant change of pace from more serious networks such as Twitter and Facebook. It’s the perfect procrastination app that can lure you in for hours.

As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.

TikTok offers you the chance to further customize the video by making modifications to the added text. Here are three ways in which you can further customize your TikTok video:</p><p><strong>1. How to Put Text on TikTok and Make It Disappear?</strong></p><p>TikTok allows you to control when your text that appears onscreen. The single condition is that it must be visible for at least one full second. All you have to do now is follow these steps to determine the length of your content.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Tap on the <strong>Text</strong> you want to edit.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll need to pick <strong>Set duration</strong> to change the time of the text on your video. This will take you to a panel where you can control when the text displays and, if necessary, when it fades away. <strong><em>Drag the timing bar</em></strong> so that it fits perfectly to choose a start and finish time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-text-duraiton-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="set text duraiton tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong><em>Drag the red box</em></strong> around the bottom of the timeline to choose when the text should appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-text-duration-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="adjust text duration tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap the <strong>Checkmark</strong> in the bottom right-hand corner once you’re done.</p><p><strong>2. How to Change TikTok Text, Font, and Size?</strong></p><p>Customization of your textual videos on TikTok isn’t restricted to adding and disappearing the text or adding multiple lines of text. You also change the text font and size of your captions by using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> By tapping the <strong>A</strong> on the left side of the display, you can <strong><em>Highlight</em></strong> the text.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can alter the <strong>Fonts</strong> by picking an alternative from the <strong><em>multi-colored circles</em></strong> at the bottom of the display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-texts-font-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="change texts font tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> TikTok further allows you to alter the color by choosing an alternative from the <strong>Color options</strong> provided on the top-left side of the text menu.</p><p><strong>3. How to Add Multiple Lines of Text to Your TikTok?</strong></p><p>One line of text isn’t always sufficient. You can add your first in-video caption by completing the procedures outlined above. Then follow these steps to learn how to use the TikTok editor to add various texts to your clips.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Tap the <strong>Text</strong> button once again once you’ve added your first line of text to your video.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Type</strong> the new caption line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-multiple-texts-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="add multiple texts tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose a <strong>Font</strong> and a <strong>Color</strong>.

But this does not mean there is no way to make a TikTok music video. Filmora is an advanced video editor for both Mac and PC that has many features that make it a great choice for TikTok videos. We’ll walk you through the process:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all, make sure that the latest version of Filmora Video editor is downloaded on your computer. If you haven’t already installed it, you can easily download it from the official website of Wondershare.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, Install the application and run it on your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A window will appear on your screen where you need to select the new project option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the next step, you need to select the aspect ratio. Keep in mind that by default, the aspect ratio will be 16:9, which is landscape, but since the TikTok videos are in portrait orientation, we need to select 9:16 and click ok.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can import the media files to your Filmora library. Just click on the file, select import media, and click on the Import media files. Now select the video files that you want to edit, and they will be imported to your Filmora Library.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now, drag the videos from the Library and drop them to your timeline. Once you have the videos in your timeline, you can perform all the edits that you want to perform.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> If you want to add effects to your videos, then you can explore the effects section of Filmora, where you can find hundreds of cool effects to make your videos more interesting. If you like any effect and want to apply it to your video, drag the effect and drop it on the video track in the Filmora timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tiktok-reaction-video-11.jpg"                      alt="make tiktok video with Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Filmora also provides you with a variety of transitions and hundreds of interesting elements and titles that you can use in your videos to make them more appealing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tiktok-reaction-video-12.jpg"                      alt="make tiktok video with Filmora - Transitions Elements Titles"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> If you are making a TikTok reaction video using Filmora, then you can easily play two videos side-by-side.

By doing this, you can easily make a reaction video in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tiktok-reaction-video-13.jpg"                      alt="how to make tiktok video with Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can add your favorite music to the background of your videos. Just import the music file to Filmora and add it to the music track in the timeline. Adjust the length of the music according to the length of the video, and it will be added to the background. You can also use the volume controls to adjust the loudness.</p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Once you are satisfied with your video, all you need to do is export it to your system in your desired format and share it with your audience on TikTok.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p><strong>●</strong> In short, Filmora is a fully-fledged video editor that provides you with a lot of extra features that you won’t get in the built-in editor of Tiktok.

This trend started on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and has spread to other social media like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.</p><p>Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools"></a>How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools</h2><p>In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.</p><p>To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.</p><p>Adding Texts in TikTok Video with TikTok: By Rhia</p><p>Moreover, the app lets you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >control the video’s playback speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply stickers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >text layers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adjust the volume <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.</p><p>The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.</p><p>This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add the description of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos</h2><p>The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks. That is why a growing number of TikTok’s users opt for third-party apps that are equipped with the tools they can use to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >improve the quality of the content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they share on this social network. Here are some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing apps you can use on iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Android devices, as well as Mac and PC computers to create videos you share on TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#imovie">1. iMovie</a></li><li><a href="#adobe">2.

Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, TikTok became one of the fastest-growing apps on both the App Store and Google Play. Teenagers are obsessed with it, but their parents don’t understand it. The government fears it, but companies eager to make money off it. TikTok probably has been the most controversial (and prevalent) social network ever.</p><p>What makes TikTok different? Initially, Tiktok is famous for its 15-second short videos, and most of the videos are lip-syncing videos. Gradually, it evolved into a community mixed with music, lip-syncing, and micro-video content. Besides providing access to an impressive music library, the app also offers a rich selection of video editing tools, which makes videos go viral quickly.</p><p>However, the US government has threatened to ban TikTok in the US recently after it had been banned in India. The growing uncertainties of TikTok has driven so many users to look for <strong>TikTok alternatives</strong>. In this article, we will go through some of the best options available to both iPhone and Android users.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Dubsmash</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Funimate</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Cheez</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Triller</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Likee</a></li></ul><h2 id="Top-5-Alternatives-to-the-TikTok-App"><a href="#Top-5-Alternatives-to-the-TikTok-App" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Alternatives to the TikTok App"></a>Top 5 Alternatives to the TikTok App</h2><p>Members of TikTok - including the Musical.ly community can’t create videos longer than one minute, which can potentially limit their options while recording music videos. What’s more, the app’s video editing capabilities are somewhat limited, since producing the cloning effect and numerous other effects require you to use more powerful video editing apps. To help you overcome these obstacles, we’ve selected some of the best music video apps on the market, so here are the five best <strong>alternatives to TikTok</strong>.</p><h4 id="1-Dubsmash"><a href="#1-Dubsmash" class="headerlink" title="1.

The fact that Dubmash has over one hundred million installs speaks volumes about its popularity today. By downloading this app, you’re becoming a part of a large community that revolves around entertaining lip-sync videos.</p><p>You can use thousands of different sounds in your videos, including movie and TV quotes, which means that you’ll always have fresh material for your videos. The app lets you add stickers and text overlays to videos so that you can make even more captivating music videos. The app displays videos in the style of Snapchat stories divided into two news feed sections so you can follow the channels you like and keep track of the latest videos posted by your friends. Besides enabling you to post music videos on your Dumbmash profile, the app lets you share your videos on other social media networks. You can save each video you produce with this app to your camera roll.</p><p>Can you believe it? Lots of movie stars are big fans of this app and Penelope Cruz is one of them.</p><h4 id="2-Funimate"><a href="#2-Funimate" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can create slow-motion videos, compile several video clips into a compilation, make video loops, and much more. The app’s huge music library grants you access to countless popular songs and sound effects, which makes it a perfect choice for lip-syncing videos.</p><p>Funimate features more than twenty advanced video effects that turn ordinary everyday moments into magical viral music videos. In addition, you can add as much text or stickers to a video as you want, so you can easily add funny comments to each video you record with this app. Making collab videos with your friends is comfortable with Funimate as you have to pick a song you both like and merge the footage into a single clip.

Triller’s video editing tools enable you to trim or cut videos, apply more than 50 filters, or even draw over the videos to express your creativity.</p><p>If you would like to collaborate with your friends, this app is a great choice, since it offers powerful collab video features. However, Triller is not a networking platform, as it is only a video editing app that doesn’t have a community aspect.

But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!</p><p>The reason?</p><p>Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!</p><p>This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.</p><p>So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?</p><p>To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.</p><p>And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright"><a href="#Why-Do-You-Need-to-Follow-Tiktok-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?"></a><strong>Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?</strong></h2><p>To avoid getting banned!</p><p>You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.</p><p>The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.</p><p>If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.</p><p>To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.</p><p>But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?</p><p>Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading"><a href="#Check-Tiktok-Video-Copyright-Before-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading"></a><strong>Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading</strong></h2><p>Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it.

The lengthier the video is, the more the loading time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stitch-option-tiktok-video.jpg"                      alt="stitch option tiktok video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When it’s finished, you’ll be sent to a screen where you may take five seconds of the film and use it on your own. To navigate through the movie, use the sliders and the red bars to choose the portion you want. When you’re finished, tap <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stitch-trim-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="stitch trim video tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You’ll be sent to TikTok’s normal recording screen. <strong>Record</strong> the remainder of your TikTok video with all of the features you’re accustomed to utilizing. You may use whatever effects, stickers, texts, voiceovers, or captions you desire. After that, press the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stitch-video-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="stitch video on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Make a title and hashtags for your TikTok video. You could also choose whether or not these users may Stitch your movie here – hit the toggle switch beside <strong>Allow Stitch</strong> to turn it off. Following that, hit the <strong>Post</strong> option, and your stitched video will be uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-stitched-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="post stitched video tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Stitch-Any-TikTok-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Stitch-Any-TikTok-Video-with-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Stitch Any TikTok Video with Filmora Video Editor?"></a>Part 4: How to Stitch Any TikTok Video with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</h2><p>Before getting started, understand why people opt for Filmora video editor for stitching videos on TikTok when this can be done through the official TikTok application. TikTok app only allows you to stitch a video for up to five seconds which is quite frustrating if you wish to stitch an entire video.</p><p>One more reason is that, with TikTok, you cannot stitch the already existing video from the camera roll, which restricts creators from adding the already edited content to the existing video. So, to avoid the above problems, Filmora is used for stitching TikTok videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>To begin, download the video that you wish to stitch with from TikTok. After, follow the below stepwise guide:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Filmora software on your PC and import the video files by clicking on the <strong>File</strong> and then <strong>Import&#x2F;Export Media</strong>. You can simply drag and drop the videos as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the clips from the media library to the Timeline’s video track. All video files will be stitched into a single video with no transitions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stitch-video-filmora.jpg"                      alt="stitch video filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add a transition to the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, go to the <strong>Transition tab</strong> and drop the desired transition to the junction of two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-stitched-video-filmora.jpg"                      alt="add transitions to stitched video filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, preview the stitched video and, when finished, click the <strong>Export</strong> option to save numerous video segments to a single file.

How do I see TikTok stitches?</strong></p><p>Users who want to view as many stitches as possible can do it by browsing for them on the app. You must first browse to <strong>Discover,</strong> and from there to the search box. Then type <strong>#Stitch @username,</strong> where the <strong>username</strong> is the name of the account from which you wish to view stitches.</p><p><strong>4. TikTok Stitch option not showing. How to fix it?</strong></p><p>Users may choose whether or not someone else can Stitch their work in their settings.
