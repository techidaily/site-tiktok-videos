However, every coin has two sides. Have you ever thought about the engagement rate of your content if the followers are not real? In the long run, I suggest you could try other tips to skyrocket growth On TikTok. Just keep reading.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Followers-on-TikTok"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Followers-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?"></a>How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?</h2><p>Creating short music videos and posting them online, demands a lot of work because you have to select the song you’re going to use, capture the footage perfectly and edit it before you can share a video on your TikTok profile. Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let’s take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.</p><h4 id="1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers"><a href="#1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers" class="headerlink" title="1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers"></a>1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers</h4><p>This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok’s most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming"><a href="#2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Your Profile Look Charming"></a>2. Make Your Profile Look Charming</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Charming Profile on TikTok"                ></p><p>Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn’t going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you’re producing fitness videos, it’s also helpful if you mention that you’re making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.</p><h4 id="3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges"><a href="#3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3. Participate in Viral Challenges"></a>3. Participate in Viral Challenges</h4><p>Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.</p><h4 id="4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks"><a href="#4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks"></a>4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks</h4><p>Don’t limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won’t be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn’t much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others"><a href="#5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others"></a>5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others</h4><p>Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn’t always pay off, especially if you’re just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you’re hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you’re going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok’s Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.</p><h4 id="6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos"><a href="#6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos"></a>6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos</h4><p>All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don’t have to use professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you’d like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >User Gallery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to empower video creation.</p><p>Free download Filmora now and make yourself a superstar on TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative"><a href="#7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Unique and Innovative"></a>7. Be Unique and Innovative</h4><p>Find your own voice, because everyone else’s voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you’ll never find your own distinctive style. What’s more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you’re really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you’re passionate about because if you’re just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don’t be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you’ll discover something your fans adore, and you’ll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise"><a href="#8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep Things Short and Concise"></a>8. Keep Things Short and Concise</h4><p>It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone’s camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.</p><h4 id="9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One"><a href="#9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One" class="headerlink" title="9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One"></a>9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Entertainer on TikTok"                ></p><p>How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don’t have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you’re going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.</p><h4 id="10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours"><a href="#10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours" class="headerlink" title="10. Post New Content At Magic Hours"></a>10. Post New Content At Magic Hours</h4><p>Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they’re using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase.

Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee"><a href="#Likee" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world. It is a social platform for sharing short videos. As with Likee, it is the perfect tool for creating the most amazing multimedia content that you can think of.</p><p>Both these apps are used for creating and sharing short videos on social media and are compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. Each of these apps offers a range of attractions for their young users.</p><p>With people debating on whether to stick with TikTok or switch to Likee, are you confused about what sets apart these video-sharing apps from each other? Here’s a detailed comparison of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Likee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headquarters</td><td>China</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Type</td><td>TikTok is a PGC (Profession Generated Content) platform</td><td>Likee is a UGC (User Generated Content) platform</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Options</td><td>A multitude of video effects Emojis, text, frames, trimming videos, and much more</td><td>AI &amp; AR-based technology Realistic hair color filters, 4D magic, superpower effects</td></tr><tr><td>Music Options</td><td>Broad and up-to-date music catalog. Third-party apps are needed to add their own music</td><td>The built-in music library is fairly limited to TikTok. Allows users to add ‘local music’</td></tr><tr><td>Text Options</td><td>Text boxes with accurate timing and positioning. The background color is adjustable</td><td>Multiple text boxes with accurate timing. Ability to change the size, font, color, angle, and background</td></tr><tr><td>Socialization</td><td>TikTok aims to redefine digital socialization by introducing online video socialization</td><td>Likee allows user to watch live streaming and make new friends by People Nearby function</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users worldwide</td><td>150 million monthly active users</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok"><a href="#Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Will Likee Surpass TikTok?"></a>Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</h2><p>With the whole “TikTok being banned in the US” becoming a thing, some assumed that competitors will soon surpass TikTok. However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed. But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos. What makes TikTok so addictive is that the app enables users to express themselves through different creative ways.</p><h4 id="2-Native-Content-Editor"><a href="#2-Native-Content-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2.Native Content Editor"></a>2.Native Content Editor</h4><p>TikTok’s features to shoot footage, quickly trim and stitch together video clips and incorporate voice as well as music effects at the touch of a button makes it the ideal destination for every creator. When it comes to Likee vs. TikTok, what makes the trim feature of TikTok so enticing is that the app allows creators to storyboard their videos and publish their finished product.</p><h4 id="3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos"><a href="#3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos"></a>3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos</h4><p>The homepage of TikTok is much more like Twitter than Instagram or Facebook. This means that viral videos with great engagement move to the front of the line and comprise the feed. Although a “Discover” tab allows you to browse specific topics and hashtags, you are served with one video at a time.</p><p>This is a part of TikTok’s competitive advantage over Likee. With an endless number of prompts, it is easy to participate since you need not have anything interesting to talk about to get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-problem.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok Problem"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.theguardian.com/" >www.theguardian.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>No matter whether you are social media lurker or a content creator, be assured that TikTok is here to stay. Don’t believe us? Try Likee for yourself and you will soon realize that TikTok is unmatchable. In fact, with a constant surge in popularity of TikTok, it is all set to become the biggest video-sharing app ever. So with that being said, do you really think Likee can surpass TikTok?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-sizzling-stories-whos-cooking-up-the-trends/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Sizzling Stories  Who's Cooking Up the Trends?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/breaking-down-discords-report-mechanism-for-clarity-and-action/"><u>Breaking Down Discord’s Report Mechanism for Clarity and Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-your-creative-voice-on-tiktok-with-this-simple-step-by-step-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Your Creative Voice on TikTok with This Simple Step-By-Step Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-uncovering-the-titans-of-gameplay-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] Uncovering the Titans of Gameplay on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/20-country-beats-on-tiktok-to-dance-and-unwind-for-2024/"><u>20 Country Beats on TikTok to Dance & Unwind for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-creme-de-la-reading-list-tiktok-endorsed-bestsellers/"><u>2024 Approved  The Crème De La Reading List  TikTok-Endorsed Bestsellers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-customizable-tikfilters-for-unique-content-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top 10 Customizable TikFilters for Unique Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-insiders-guide-to-using-siri-on-tiktok-applications/"><u>[Updated] The Insider's Guide to Using Siri on TikTok Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/simple-ways-to-get-recent-calls-back-from-y78plus-t1-edition-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Simple ways to get recent calls back from Y78+ (T1) Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-vimeo-overview-the-world-of-independent-film-hosting/"><u>2024 Approved  Vimeo Overview  The World of Independent Film Hosting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-lock-your-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-phone-in-style-the-top-5-gesture-lock-screen-apps-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Lock Your Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G Phone in Style The Top 5 Gesture Lock Screen Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unraveling-the-secrets-to-captivating-asmr-scenarios-and-effects/"><u>2024 Approved  Unraveling the Secrets to Captivating ASMR Scenarios and Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-vivo-v29-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Vivo V29 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/newly-updated-set-of-chat-starters-for-podcast-success-for-2024/"><u>Newly Updated Set of Chat Starters for Podcast Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-sim-pin-code-on-your-nokia-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Nokia Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unleash-your-creativity-top-10-imovie-like-apps-for-android/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Unleash Your Creativity Top 10 iMovie-Like Apps for Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-expert-picks-top-10-live-broadcast-apps-for-basketball-and-soccer-fans/"><u>[Updated] Expert Picks  Top 10 Live-Broadcast Apps for Basketball and Soccer Fans</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Here’s a handy guide on <strong>Triller vs TikTok</strong>.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would take steps to ban TikTok - the popular short-term video app from operating in the USA, unless the app’s US operations were sold to an American company. With a rising tide of uncertainties surrounding TikTok’s future in the United States, TikTokers and short-form video creators are getting drawn to rival platforms like Triller.</p><p>The Trump administration and other critics of TikTok fear that the data the app collects in its US users might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. However, TikTok has said that it stores users’ data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to grab the information.</p><p>Amid these confidentiality concerns and an impending ban imposed by the Trump administration, more and more users are now switching to Triller. In fact, as TikTok faces uncertainties between being banned or bought in the US, rival app Triller has received a big boost and attained the No.1 spot in Apple’s US App Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/triller-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok vs. Triller going on all around, here’s a detailed insight on everything you need to know about these social video apps.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Triller"><a href="#Triller" class="headerlink" title="Triller"></a>Triller</h4><p>Triller is an artificial intelligence-driven video app released in the year 2015, thus allowing users to film videos with music. Then, the video and music content is synced algorithmically, thus automating the editing part which users can manually do on TikTok. Users can record multiple takes of themselves and using AI, the app will compile the best clips together for creating a music video.</p><p>Triller is a music video app that’s specifically built for creators. In Triller, users can collaborate with each other, use custom or existing sounds, and filters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-triller.jpg"                      alt="What Is Triller"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Launched in the year 2016, TikTok served the Chinese market originally. A year later, when TikTok appeared on mobile platforms around the world, it completely swept off the internet. Owned by ByteDance - a Beijing-based internet technology company, it is a Chinese social video-sharing app.</p><p>With this app, users can record a video with their smartphone, edit the video, add music, and then upload it on the platform. It is a short-form video sharing mobile app that lets users create and share 15-second videos on any topic. Today, with more than 800 million monthly active users and 1.5 billion downloads; TikTok is one of the most popular mobile applications worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="What Is Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?"></a>Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</h2><p>Triller, the most popular alternative to TikTok is one of the many video-led social applications that are riding a wave of anti-TikTok sentiments. In the words of Triller co-owner Ryan Kavanaugh, “We see ourselves as the adult version of TikTok”. The target audience of this music video-sharing app is between the age group of 17 to 27. Mainly, it is popular among top streaming artists, hip hop artists, and the music industry.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok has a strong reputation for being popular with teenagers and young adults, the GenZ. While 27% of its total users are between the age group of 13-17 years, its largest age demographics (42%) are the younger adults. So when combined, the 13-24 age group represents about 69% of the app’s user base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-triller-vs-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="Who Uses Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>At a glance, TikTok and Triller seem to have a lot in common. These social video apps provide users with an excellent way to showcase their creativity. Both these apps allow you to edit and share videos, have an extensive music library, and allow you to share videos on other social networking apps.</p><p>But, besides the similarities, there are major differences. In fact, with the Trump administration’s concerns over TikTok, many are contemplating Triller vs. TikTok. Even though both the apps offer pretty much similar services, certain features set them apart from each other.</p><p>Here’s a handy comparison outlining the notable differences between TikTok and Triller:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Triller</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Place Of Origin</td><td>China</td><td>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users, with more than 2 billion downloads</td><td>65 million active users, with more than 250m downloads</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Page</td><td>Trending hashtags, promoted ad campaigns</td><td>Leaderboards, trending hashtags, categorized genre charts, promoted ad campaigns</td></tr><tr><td>Video Duration</td><td>TikTok users can make videos of 15 seconds only</td><td>Triller users can make full music videos to whole tracks</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Capabilities</td><td>User-based, ability to add text in particular parts of the clips, range of speeds, effects, overlays, etc.</td><td>A.I.-based, fast motion&#x2F;slow motion, text (basic), overlays</td></tr><tr><td>Music</td><td>Only allows listening to 15-seconds of a song, only lets you use music that is ingested in the app in the videos</td><td>Only allows listen to full songs, can use music that is Triller, Spotify, or Apple Music</td></tr><tr><td>AI Deployment</td><td>Analyzes the users’ preferences and interests through engagement and displays a personalized feed to every user</td><td>Analyzes biometric movements of videos and adapts them to a song’s beat</td></tr><tr><td>Genre</td><td>TikTokers can make videos on any topic, regardless of the genre</td><td>Triller seems to favor EDM and hip-hop</td></tr><tr><td>Sharability</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps"><a href="#How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps" class="headerlink" title="How To Make Money On The Two Apps?"></a>How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</h2><p>Amid Triller vs. TikTok, the hunt for the better social video platform is on. Although TikTok’s fate in the US is still hanging on the balance, its popularity and usage still continue to sky-rocket in other territories.</p><p>Wondering if you should really switch to Triller or stick with TikTok, for now, to show off your brand? Read on for a quick review.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Marketing Influencers</strong></p><p>TikTok is undoubtedly a better social video platform for marketing influencers worldwide in terms of reach. Wondering why? Well, in comparison to Triller’s 65m, TikTok has 800 million active users. Moreover, unlike Triller that’s available only in 50 countries, TikTok is available in 155 countries. Also, TikTok has successfully launched a generation of influencers who had started as non-celebrities.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Brand Building</strong></p><p>Leveraging TikTok can be the key to increasing social brand awareness. This is because with TikTok’s audience growing BY every second, you can use the platform to build your brand. Triller also gives brands a great platform for increasing exposure and get a better share of voice on social media. Just like TikTok, Triller is a fun way for brands to promote their products in their video content.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Advertising</strong></p><p>TikTok provides advertisers with several options to reach their target demographic. When TikTokers open the app, ads appear and take over the screen completely for a few seconds before it turns into an in-feed video ad. From ad creation and targeting to insight reports and ad management tools, TikTok ads offer an easy-to-use and powerful platform for businesses to advertise. On the other hand, Triller doesn’t include ads currently. Instead, it focuses on letting creators raise money from followers and advertisers as well as crowdfund.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Content Creators</strong></p><p>To choose the better platform between Triller and TikTok, consider asking yourself a few questions like – What kind of content creators are you creating? Do you spend more time in conceptualizing the message of your video? Would you rather simplify the editing process or have greater flexibility in editing?</p><p>While TikTok features a range of editing tools to give content creators the flexibility of creating the content they want, Triller deploys AI to edit videos for the creator. So, with Triller, you can simply let artificial intelligence compile the best clips for creating a quality video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-money-on-triller-tiktok.png"                      alt="Make Money On Triller Tiktok"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.startupnews.fyi/" >www.startupnews.fyi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>At a time when the internet is divided on whether they should abandon TikTok, the Trump administration approved a deal for Walmart and Oracle to acquire stakes in the US operations of TikTok, thus postponing the potential ban that was planned due to the national security concerns regarding the Chinese owned company. So, US-based TikTokers can finally sigh in relief.</p><p>In summary, both TikTok and Triller offer incredible value to their expanding user base. While TikTok specifically appears to cater to all kinds of publishers and creators, Triller is specifically focused on the artists in the music industry. Videos are all about people smiling, dancing, and having a great time. So, instead of being stressed, get creative and have as much fun as possible!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/essential-10-tikfilters-for-striking-tiktok-videos-for-2024/"><u>Essential 10 TikFilters for Striking TikTok Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-embrace-freedom-with-easy-watermark-free-tiktok-videos/"><u>In 2024, Embrace Freedom with Easy, Watermark-Free TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-explore-the-journey-creating-a-one-of-a-kind-tiktok-hash/"><u>2024 Approved  Explore the Journey  Creating a One-of-a-Kind TikTok Hash</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instant-tunes-live-streaming-on-bigolive/"><u>2024 Approved  Instant Tunes Live Streaming on BigoLive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/meme-mayhem-meets-madness-top-10-craziest-tiktok-game-screencaps/"><u>Meme Mayhem Meets Madness  Top 10 Craziest TikTok Game Screencaps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-stop-the-frenzy-fixing-a-mistaken-tiktok-reload/"><u>[Updated] Stop the Frenzy – Fixing a Mistaken TikTok Reload</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-become-a-tiktok-icon-top-unique-personalities-and-pfps-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Become a TikTok Icon  Top Unique Personalities and PFPs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/joke-journey-uncovering-top-talents-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>Joke Journey  Uncovering Top Talents on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/the-top-5-android-apps-that-use-fingerprint-sensor-to-lock-your-apps-on-vivo-v30-lite-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Top 5 Android Apps That Use Fingerprint Sensor to Lock Your Apps On Vivo V30 Lite 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/preparation-to-beat-giovani-in-pokemon-go-for-apple-iphone-15-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Apple iPhone 15 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-decoding-canine-emotional-outbursts-recognizing-irritation-in-barks/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Decoding Canine Emotional Outbursts Recognizing Irritation in Barks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimizing-your-snapchat-ads-for-maximum-monetization/"><u>2024 Approved  Optimizing Your Snapchat Ads for Maximum Monetization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/tackling-text-transformations-converting-xmlttml-for-voice-outputs-for-2024/"><u>Tackling Text Transformations  Converting XML/TTML for Voice Outputs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exporting-mp3-files-from-watched-facebook-vids/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Exporting MP3 Files From Watched Facebook Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/undeleted-lost-videos-from-realme-c55-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>Undeleted lost videos from Realme C55</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-stand-out-with-yt-shorts-essential-guidelines-to-follow/"><u>2024 Approved  Stand Out with YT Shorts  Essential Guidelines to Follow</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-mp4-file-optimization-removing-unwanted-audio-tracks/"><u>New MP4 File Optimization Removing Unwanted Audio Tracks</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.</p><p>If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video.

Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

The first among these is the place where you write your bio and enter your username in the application. Here, you can simply cut and paste any text you want. This includes the text you create using a TikTok fonts generator. On the other hand, the second is more complex. It is where you can add text as an overlay to the short videos you create using this application. You can add text to the video only after you shoot your video footage, i.e. – in the second stage of your video creation.</p><p>To start the video-creation process, click on the + icon located in the center bottom of your TikTok app. This will bring up the camera view. It is here that you will record the video clips and make some adjustments.</p><p>The next stage is where you need to make some fundamental decisions like if you will take videos using the app’s camera or whether you will be uploading other video clips. Also, you have to decide if you will use the flash and if you will record by setting a timer or pushing the big Record button.</p><p>Even though the video record screen will allow you to set a few creative options like adding effects, filters, and music to the video you are all set to record, you won’t be able to add text. You will have to record at least one video clip so that you can trim and add it together with other videos at the editing stage. It is at this editing stage that Tik Tok will provide you the opportunity to use text and customize it in your video.</p><p>Here’s how you can add and customize your text in TikTok videos-</p><p>Step-1: Click on the “Text” option (You will notice the <strong>Aa</strong> symbol above it)</p><p>Step-2: Type in the text you want in your video</p><p>Step-3: Customize your text by using the options available to you-</p><ul><li>By tapping on the <strong>A</strong> on the left side of your screen, you can highlight your text</li><li>You will be able to change the text’s font through the options listed on the text menu’s top-left side. To change the color, choose an option from the colorful circles at the screen’s bottom</li></ul><p>Step-4: when ready, click on <strong>Done</strong> on your screen’s top-right side. Keep in mind that you will be able to change the timing and placement of your text only after this point.</p><p>Step-5: Next, drag your text to the area where you want it to appear and then tap on it for more options.</p><p>Step-6: Choose <strong>Set Duration</strong> if you wish to adjust the timing of your text on the video. This will bring you to the screen where you will be able to adjust when the text appears and disappears.</p><p>Step-7: Tap on the play button situated just above the editing bar to see how your text looks. Once you are happy with it, choose the checkmark in the screen’s bottom-right corner.</p><p>Step-8: Click “Next” to simply continue in the video creation process to add a description and any other information you desire. Once done, hit <strong>Post.</strong></p><h2 id="How-do-Stylish-TikTok-Fonts-Help-You-Gain-More-Views"><a href="#How-do-Stylish-TikTok-Fonts-Help-You-Gain-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?"></a>How do Stylish TikTok Fonts Help You Gain More Views?</h2><p>As simple as it may sound, using attractive TikTok fonts can help your videos get widely recognized, thus gaining more views.

After all, they’re just a few seconds of a clip at the end of your videos. Why not just let the video end and move on?</p><p>Well, TikTok outros are actually a really important part of the platform. They’re a great way to promote your other social media platforms, give your viewers a call to action, or just show off your personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-outros-for-tiktok.png"                      alt="create outros for tiktok"                ></p><p>In this article, we’ll show you how to <strong>create an outro for TikTok</strong> that is sure to leave an ever-lasting impression on those watching your content. In the end, we’ll recommend the best video editors that you can use to make your videos engaging by creating the perfect outros every time.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Things-You-Should-Know-About-the-Outro-in-a-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Things-You-Should-Know-About-the-Outro-in-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video"></a>Part 1. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video</h2><p>The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.</p><p>An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.</p><p>Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it’s important to make it count!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png"                      alt="outros template"                ></p><h3 id="Elements-of-an-Outro"><a href="#Elements-of-an-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an Outro"></a>Elements of an Outro</h3><p>Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:</p><ul><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it’s released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.</li><li><strong>The Next Video to Watch:</strong> If you have other episodes&#x2F;parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.</li><li><strong>Your Social Media Channels:</strong> Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.</li><li><strong>Use Stunning Visuals:</strong> Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.</li></ul><h3 id="How-To-Make-an-Advanced-Good-Outro"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-Advanced-Good-Outro" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?"></a>How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?</h3><p>If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.</p><p>To <strong>create a good outro for your TikTok</strong>, follow the below tips:</p><ul><li>Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.</li><li>Keep your outro short and sweet because you don’t want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.</li><li>Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.</li><li>Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and&#x2F;or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.</li><li>Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.</li><li>Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-An-Excellent-Video-Editor-for-Your-TikTok-Adventure"><a href="#Part-2-An-Excellent-Video-Editor-for-Your-TikTok-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Here is how you do it:</p><p>1.First, you select and open the Tik Tok dance video you want to use on FilmoraX and drag it into the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/import-media-files-on-filmorax.jpg"                      alt="import media files on filmorax"                ></p><p>2.Now you will want to check that the main body of the subject is in the entire frame.

Then, select the “render-effect” option so that Filmora can analyze the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.box.jpg"                      alt="32box"                ></p><p>6.Now you can add the object you want to have to follow the track. You can choose that from the title menu or add a new image from your Mac.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.import-media.jpg"                      alt="32import media"                ></p><p>7.Once you choose your object, you simply need to drag that object to the track above your footage.</p><p>8.Next, you will need to place the object where you want it to be concerning the subject in the preview box. Make sure that you drag the edge of it on the timeline to match it with the timeline of your subject.</p><p>9.When it has been set up, you will need to double-click the footage you have added the tracking function to and go to the motion tracking menu.</p><p>10.The drop-down menu will show all the texts and images or animations available.

And the first place to begin with that aim is in your TikTok bio.</p><p>Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.</p><p>It’s because you don’t want to consume time to introduce yourself in every video, again and again, so your <strong>TikTok bios</strong> provide you with the opportunity to do just that. This is your chance to describe to your followers who you are and why they should be your followers.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Here, we’ll cover how to add a link to TikTok bio, 30+ TikTok bio ideas, and other fantastic tools to upgrade your TikTok profile.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Top 5 TikTok Bio Fonts Generators of 2024</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Best TikTok Tools for Video Editing</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Optimize-Your-TikTok-Bio-in-5-Easy-Steps-updated-2024"><a href="#Part-1-Optimize-Your-TikTok-Bio-in-5-Easy-Steps-updated-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]"></a>Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps [updated 2024]</h2><p>Writing a TikTok bio doesn’t have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-3-30-TikTok-Bio-Ideas-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-30-TikTok-Bio-Ideas-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024"></a>Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024</h2><p>Light travels faster than sound. That’s why people look bright until they speak.</p><p>Time is relevant. Waste it genuinely</p><p>Hey, are you on my bio again?</p><p>I learn from the mistakes of others who took my advice.</p><p>Wait, where am I? How did I get in here?</p><p>Error 400: Unavailable Bio.</p><p>One person’s #WTF is another person’s #LOL.</p><p>I am considered at the gym by my “before picture.”</p><p>It doesn’t matter #LOL, if you don’t mind.</p><p>Marriage is a real eye-opener, though love may be blind @-@.</p><p>Beer is evidence that God wants us to be happy and loves us.</p><p>I have to be funny because a hot word is not for my dictionary.</p><p>Two minutes words of my life when I tried to be simple.</p><p>I am sleep-deprived and half-sane.</p><p>I transformed my password to ‘incorrect.’ Now, my password is incorrect</p><p>Born not to impress, but to express.</p><p>We are all part of the random statistic – ten out of ten dies.</p><p>I’m awesome, but global warming made me HOT</p><p>I can’t remember who I stole my bio from or why.</p><p>Free international shipping.</p><p>Share your images with us using #(branded hashtag).</p><p>Probably the great meat eater on the globe.</p><p>I’d rather steal your dessert than a boyfriend.</p><p>Making PJs look dope since (year of birth).</p><p>Sweet as sugar, tough as nails.</p><p>Gifted napper, talker, and ice cream eater.</p><p>Messy bun and having fun.</p><p>Humble, with just a portray of Kanye.</p><p>My hobbies are lunch and dinner, and breakfast topped with a chocolate dessert.</p><p>First, I drink the coffee.

A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.</p><p>Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, <strong>text to speech on TikTok</strong> lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.</p><p>TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.</p><p>Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.</p><p>Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?"></a>Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</h2><p>In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version"><a href="#Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version"></a>Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version</h4><p>First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="latest version tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording a Video"></a>Step 2: Start Recording a Video</h4><p>Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘<strong>Done</strong>’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png"                      alt="enter text tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech"></a>Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech</h4><p>When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png"                      alt="tap-text-to speech tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally"><a href="#Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Save the Video Locally"></a>Step 5: Save the Video Locally</h4><p>It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “<strong>Save to Device</strong>” option is active and you can post it privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="save-to device tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers"><a href="#Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers"></a>Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers</h4><p>Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave"><a href="#Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave"></a>Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave</h4><p>Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok"><a href="#Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok"></a>Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok</h4><p>Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits.

Just keep reading.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Followers-on-TikTok"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Followers-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?"></a>How to Get Free Followers on TikTok?</h2><p>Creating short music videos and posting them online, demands a lot of work because you have to select the song you’re going to use, capture the footage perfectly and edit it before you can share a video on your TikTok profile. Throughout all of the stages of this process, there are things you can do that can help you attract a broad audience, so let’s take a look at some of the best ways to increase the reach of your videos.</p><h4 id="1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers"><a href="#1-Follow-and-Unfollow-the-Most-Popular-Musers" class="headerlink" title="1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers"></a>1. Follow and Unfollow the Most Popular Musers</h4><p>This is a simple and effective way to gain the attention of TikTok’s most influential users. Pinpoint the most successful Musers in your niche and follow and unfollow them until they follow you back. Although it may seem silly, this strategy actually works, because, after enough attempts, your favorite members of the platform will look at your profile, and follow you back if they like what they see. Try to comment on their videos, because TikTok stars share on their profiles can potentially increase the chances of being followed back, especially if your comments are always on point. Some of the people whose work you appreciate maybe even willing to share their secrets and help you get more followers.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming"><a href="#2-Make-Your-Profile-Look-Charming" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Your Profile Look Charming"></a>2. Make Your Profile Look Charming</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/charming-profile-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Charming Profile on TikTok"                ></p><p>Every little detail matters when it comes to optimizing your profile. The profile picture, username, or the personal information you provide can all leave a strong impression on people who visit your profile. A long username that is hard to remember isn’t going to help you gain more recognition, mostly because everyone is going to forget it soon after they hear it. Pick a short and catchy username that stands out and try avoiding using different usernames on different social media accounts. Let others know what types of videos they can expect from you by mentioning that you love making fitness videos, vlogs, or simple music videos in which you showcase your singing talents. However, it is also indispensable to be as specific as you can, so besides saying that you’re producing fitness videos, it’s also helpful if you mention that you’re making yoga or aerobics videos. Your profile is the first step to establishing communication with new followers, which is why it is important to do everything you can to encourage others to hit the follow button and start communicating with you.</p><h4 id="3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges"><a href="#3-Participate-in-Viral-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3. Participate in Viral Challenges"></a>3. Participate in Viral Challenges</h4><p>Following the latest social media trends is necessary because it enables you to see what other types of content are popular at the moment. Viral challenges, like the recent Kiki challenge, often involve singing and dancing to a popular song, which is why they are a great choice of content for the TikTok platform that is mostly dedicated to music videos. Using trending hashtags in the posts you share on your profile will make your viral challenge videos visible to millions of people, and it can increase your number of followers drastically in just a few days. In addition, a challenge can inspire you to explore a specific topic or a music genre further and help you build an easily recognizable style that can expand the size of your fanbase.</p><h4 id="4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks"><a href="#4-Post-Your-Videos-on-Other-Social-Networks" class="headerlink" title="4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks"></a>4. Post Your Videos on Other Social Networks</h4><p>Don’t limit yourself to just one social media account because if you do so, you won’t be able to reach the audiences on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Facebook alone has 2 billion active users each month, while the size of the audience on YouTube isn’t much smaller. Managing accounts on several social networks under the same name is also an effective way to build your online reputation because people will remember the name they saw on one platform. As a result, they will start following you on the other. Posting music and all various types of videos on multiple social media accounts also means that they are going to be shared by a larger number of people.</p><h4 id="5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others"><a href="#5-Don’t-Hesitate-to-Collaborate-with-Others" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others"></a>5. Don’t Hesitate to Collaborate with Others</h4><p>Being a one-man or a one-woman show doesn’t always pay off, especially if you’re just starting out. Recording a duo with an equally talented friend or making any other type of collab video can have a positive impact on the size of your fanbase. It is important to choose the people you work with carefully because content creators that already have a lot of followers might not be interested in collaborating with you if the number of followers you have is significantly lower than theirs. The people you choose to work with should also share your passion for the type of video you’re hoping to create since there is no point in inviting someone to make a comedy video with you if their main interest is in fashion. After selecting the person, you’re going to collaborate with. You can use the TikTok’s Duet option that offers an easy way to create a music video with someone who shares your taste in music.</p><h4 id="6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos"><a href="#6-Use-Video-Editing-Apps-to-Make-Impressive-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos"></a>6. Use Video Editing Apps to Make Impressive Videos</h4><p>All videos, regardless of how short they are, benefit from the video editing process. You don’t have to use professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut to edit the videos you share on TikTok, because some other video editing apps offer more eye-catching filters and effects to make a captivating short music video. One of them is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The TikTok app enables you to remove all unwanted parts of the video clips you recorded, and it also features a rich library of visual effects, but it lacks some more advanced video editing options. If you’d like to create the ghost effect or to clone yourself using apps such as Video Star, Triller or MuStar is a much better option, because they offer a wider range of video editing tools than TikTok. You can also learn more user-created content from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >User Gallery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to empower video creation.</p><p>Free download Filmora now and make yourself a superstar on TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative"><a href="#7-Be-Unique-and-Innovative" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Unique and Innovative"></a>7. Be Unique and Innovative</h4><p>Find your own voice, because everyone else’s voice is already taken. If you try to imitate the content other creators produce, you’ll never find your own distinctive style. What’s more, the viewers of your video can easily see if you’re really enjoying making the video or not, and in many cases, that may be the reason why they decide to skip hitting the follow button. Chose topics that you’re passionate about because if you’re just following the trends, the content you produce may seem generic. Don’t be afraid to think out of the box and do something new every once in a while. Just to see how your followers react. More often than not, you’ll discover something your fans adore, and you’ll attract new followers that liked your eagerness to try out new things.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise"><a href="#8-Keep-Things-Short-and-Concise" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep Things Short and Concise"></a>8. Keep Things Short and Concise</h4><p>It is not possible to record videos with the TikTok app that last longer than sixty seconds. Therefore, sticking to the one-minute limit is probably the best way to ensure that your followers watch all videos you post on your account from the beginning until the end. There is no time limit for videos you upload to your account, so you can use your phone’s camera app to make videos that are longer than one minute. However, you should tread carefully since the longer duration of a video can discourage viewers from watching the entire video. Producing short music videos can be a challenging task, but it is also a great way to showcase your creativity and inspire others to follow your work.</p><h4 id="9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One"><a href="#9-You’re-Entertainer-Act-Like-One" class="headerlink" title="9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One"></a>9. You’re Entertainer, Act Like One</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/entertainer-on-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Entertainer on TikTok"                ></p><p>How can you expect others to have fun while watching your videos, if you don’t have fun making them? Be spontaneous, and enjoy your time in front of the camera. That way you can always keep the spectator guessing what you’re going to do next. Put on a good show, that will leave the viewers of your videos wanting to see more. You can accomplish this by adding a lot of humor to the video or by simply enjoying the moment and going with the flow. Even though there are no recipes to the success of the content you post on the TikTok platform, focusing on your performance while remembering to be funny at times is going to help you increase the number of followers.</p><h4 id="10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours"><a href="#10-Post-New-Content-At-Magic-Hours" class="headerlink" title="10. Post New Content At Magic Hours"></a>10. Post New Content At Magic Hours</h4><p>Sharing new content at least twice a day will eventually get you a massive following, because it will improve the exposure your videos are getting, but you also have to post videos at the right time. The magic posting hours on TikTok are between 11 am and 5 pm as your followers and their friends are most likely to use the app in that time frame. Get to know your audience and try to understand how frequently and at which hours they’re using the TikTok app. This will help you create a posting schedule that minimizes the chances of posting videos during parts of the day when they get the least amount of exposure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Be different, be unique, and provide high-quality entertainment to your followers. Try to offer something fresh that will sweep your audience off their feet. The TikTok app features a nearly endless supply of music and video editing options that enable you to express your creativity freely. However, just producing great videos is not enough to attract large audiences since you also have to employ your marketing skills if you want to grow your fanbase.

However, Snapchat marketing can be challenging, as the platform constantly evolves and changes.</p><p>This article provides an overview of <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy,</strong> including why businesses should market on this platform, what types of content to post, and how to measure results.</p><p>With the information available in this article, you will be able to create a strategy that works for your business and get succeeded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/snapchat-app.jpg"                      alt="snapchat app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Snapchat-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-Snapchat-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Snapchat Overview"></a>Part 1. Snapchat Overview</h2><p>Firstly, let’s have an overview of Snapchat before we see how to draw your blueprint in Part 3 and Part 4.</p><p>Snapchat - founded by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown - is a unique messaging app because it allows users to send disappearing messages and photos. This feature has made the app popular with young people aged 13-34 who want to communicate without leaving a permanent record.</p><p>As of May 2022, Snapchat has <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=How%20many%20daily%20active%20users,increase%20of%20over%2018%20percent." >347 million daily active users. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> That’s impressive growth from its humble beginnings back in 2011. With <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/" >monthly active users of 557 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Snapchat is ranked as the 12th most popular social media platform.</p><p>Not only that, the number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/snapchat-statistics/" >Snapchat daily video views is 18 billion, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> making it the best platform to showcase your services&#x2F;products and generate more income. However, all this is only possible with the right <strong>Snapchat marketing strategy.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-Business-Market-On-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat"></a>Part 2. Why Should Business Market On Snapchat</h2><p>So you are probably thinking why your business should be on Snapchat - because it’s popular with teenagers and young adults. In fact, the platform has over 347 million daily active users, with <strong>75%</strong> being under the age of 34.</p><p>Therefore, if you’re targeting a younger demographic, then Snapchat should definitely be part of your social media marketing strategy.</p><p>Another big reason is that Snapchat is incredibly engaging. The average Snapchat user opens the app at least 20 times a day and spends 25 - 30 minutes on the app each day, so that’s a lot of potential exposure for your business.</p><p>Not only that, but since Snapchat is still a new field and opened up <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija" >ads to users in October 2014, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> many big companies have not entered the market. This has created a huge opportunity for small businesses to market their products and generate leads to increase their sales.</p><p>With Snapchat, you can get discovered by users in their Discovery feeds or via Stories. Also, they can interact with your brand using the Geofilters, stickers, and lenses you’ve produced during your ad campaign.</p><p>For instance, Taco Bell created a filter for Cinco de Mayo. The filter received 224 Million views, which is insane. Nevertheless, this campaign kept users engaged and helped increase Taco Bell’s sales.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/taco-bell-cinco-de-mayo-filter-on-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="taco bell cinco de mayo filter on snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy"><a href="#Part-3-Where-To-Start-Your-Snapchat-Marketing-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.
