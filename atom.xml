However, influencers who are enrolled in the Creator Fund have reported that TikTok pays them between 2 and 4 cents per 1000 views.</p><p>TikTok Creator Fund payout depends on a range of factors in relation to your profile and the content you create. These factors include views count and their authenticity, number of engagement, the region where the views come from, and total followers compared to likes. Performance on this social media platform is dynamic as it changes naturally. Besides, the daily funding amount can differ depending on the number of videos released on that day. So, the specific amount differs from one person to another.</p><p>Now that you have an idea of the creator fund payout, you might be wondering about top TikTok creators who have monetized their content. Here’s a list of TikTok’s 5 highest paid TikTokers based on Forbes’ list of the highest-earning stars in 2020:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Addison-Rae-Easterling"><a href="#1-Addison-Rae-Easterling" class="headerlink" title="1.Addison Rae Easterling"></a>1.Addison Rae Easterling</h3><p>Louisiana-native Addison Rae is TikTok’s top-earning star who earns $5 million in just a year.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918661/19272" target="_top" id="1918661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918661/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space.

Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105860/7443" target="_top" id="2105860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility.

There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.</p><p>If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video. This has to be engaging enough to attract more and more followers. The primary aim of an introduction video is to say high to your followers and tell them about yourself. With this video, they will get to know you better.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Upload a Video to TikTok from Mac or PC&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone"><a href="#Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

This trend started on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and has spread to other social media like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.</p><p>Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools"></a>How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools</h2><p>In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.</p><p>To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.</p><p>Adding Texts in TikTok Video with TikTok: By Rhia</p><p>Moreover, the app lets you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >control the video’s playback speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply stickers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >text layers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adjust the volume <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.</p><p>The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.</p><p>This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add the description of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos</h2><p>The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks. That is why a growing number of TikTok’s users opt for third-party apps that are equipped with the tools they can use to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >improve the quality of the content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they share on this social network.

Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, TikTok became one of the fastest-growing apps on both the App Store and Google Play. Teenagers are obsessed with it, but their parents don’t understand it. The government fears it, but companies eager to make money off it. TikTok probably has been the most controversial (and prevalent) social network ever.</p><p>What makes TikTok different? Initially, Tiktok is famous for its 15-second short videos, and most of the videos are lip-syncing videos. Gradually, it evolved into a community mixed with music, lip-syncing, and micro-video content. Besides providing access to an impressive music library, the app also offers a rich selection of video editing tools, which makes videos go viral quickly.</p><p>However, the US government has threatened to ban TikTok in the US recently after it had been banned in India. The growing uncertainties of TikTok has driven so many users to look for <strong>TikTok alternatives</strong>. In this article, we will go through some of the best options available to both iPhone and Android users.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Dubsmash</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Funimate</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Cheez</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Triller</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Likee</a></li></ul><h2 id="Top-5-Alternatives-to-the-TikTok-App"><a href="#Top-5-Alternatives-to-the-TikTok-App" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Alternatives to the TikTok App"></a>Top 5 Alternatives to the TikTok App</h2><p>Members of TikTok - including the Musical.ly community can’t create videos longer than one minute, which can potentially limit their options while recording music videos.

To help you overcome these obstacles, we’ve selected some of the best music video apps on the market, so here are the five best <strong>alternatives to TikTok</strong>.</p><h4 id="1-Dubsmash"><a href="#1-Dubsmash" class="headerlink" title="1.

Also, remember that these tools are not in any way associated with Tik Tok officially. Instead, they act as supportive platforms for calculation.</p><h4 id="1-Tik-Tok-Influencer-Earnings-Calculator"><a href="#1-Tik-Tok-Influencer-Earnings-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, their project of biddable ads is in progress. It will be launched soon after completion. What brands search for are different influencers either according to the niche or growth of a particular Tik Tok account. Nowadays, influencers have to contact brands for promotions or stuff like that. So, if you have more count on followers and engagement as an influencer, you would be going to get the right amount on those sponsorships.</p><p>The most important aspect is to calculate the engagement rate. It is because it’s a highly considerable factor brand may look. However, there is no official method to calculate the engagement rate. Most of the published ones are inaccurate. They won’t tell you the correct specs about the percentage of people opening the app once a day. For accuracy concerns, we’ve devised a formula to calculate individual Tik Tok account engagement. The formula states as [No. of hearts + No. of comments]&#x2F; No. of followers] × 100.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Calculates engagement rate</li><li>DIY method</li><li>Zero cost solution</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Not super effective</li></ul><h4 id="2-Igface"><a href="#2-Igface" class="headerlink" title="2.

TikTok now seems to be a part of everyone’s life through the most popular lip-syncing videos, one-act dance routines, 1-min recipes, funny clips, and stuff like the bottle cap challenge.</p><p>More or less the heart and soul of today’s teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World’s 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.</p><p>What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one’s talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom. Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.</p><p>If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing <strong>TikTok ideas</strong> to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</a></li></ul><h2 id="TikTok-vs-YouTube"><a href="#TikTok-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs YouTube"></a>TikTok vs YouTube</h2><p>TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!</p><h4 id="3-Calming-Videos"><a href="#3-Calming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Calming Videos"></a>3. Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4. Objects Singing Videos</h4><p>One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.</p><p>See if <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1079418894538940418" >Pikachu and his orchestra can provide you with some inspiration <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Art-Videos"><a href="#5-Art-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5. Art Videos"></a>5. Art Videos</h4><p>This one is for all the artists out there. If you are someone who creates figurines, pictures, or any other form of art, then don’t let your creative process go unnoticed – rather, film it and put it up as a Tik Tok video. The social media platform has many takers for such videos that show the process behind every creative job as it helps give a view into the thought process of an artist, however minute. This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run. Add some creative twists to these videos and help them stand out in the crowd.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxvZ78YHEUf/" >showing off their artistic skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-1-Minute-Recipes"><a href="#6-1-Minute-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="6.1-Minute Recipes"></a>6.1-Minute Recipes</h4><p>If you are a cooking aficionado and often dabble around in the kitchen for preparing new recipes, then TikTok is a good place to share your cooking videos. While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible. Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature. If cooking is not your thing, you can also post videos of what you eat every day – there is a sizable follower base for that category as well!</p><p>Chef Shereen will show you <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingwithshereen/video/6841303083289464070" >how to cook a Santa Claus Melon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here</p><h4 id="7-Animal-Videos"><a href="#7-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Animal Videos"></a>7. Animal Videos</h4><p>Oh, those amazing creations of the Almighty! When it comes to cute pet clips, there is very little you can go wrong with. Be it tricks, reaction to your singing, or simply them having a jolly good time, there is always a lot of attention on pets. If you have not done so already, it is time to capture the acts of your pets on camera and start pulling in the followers. The music needs to be as adorable as the pets themselves and make sure they are at ease doing what you ask them to do. The more authentic the reaction, the more attention your video will get. Use the shots where you get the sincerest reactions to come up with the most interesting clips.</p><p>Just look at this <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLCv72DpcY/" >adorable little doggo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas"><a href="#8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="8. Funny TikTok Ideas"></a>8. Funny TikTok Ideas</h4><p>Narrate funny stories with your twist in the narrative, few sources of entertainment can be as good! Even asking a simple question could count under this category. Don’t be dissuaded by the short time frame. You can also come up with your own stories about things you observed around you on a day-to-day basis. As long as you keep it hilarious, your fans will love it.</p><h4 id="9-Words-of-Positivity"><a href="#9-Words-of-Positivity" class="headerlink" title="9. Words of Positivity"></a>9. Words of Positivity</h4><p>You are sure to have a favorite song. How about tweaking the lyrics a bit to make it sound more current, something that fits in better with current sentiments? Love for the environment, gender diversity, anti-racism, are some of the genres you can work with. The more resounding your message, the more will be the views it generates. Ensure your new lyrics are in tune with the overall tempo of the song and focus on keeping it positive.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1081608132382609413" >promoting respect for women <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="10-Challenges"><a href="#10-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="10.

So, if you are looking to boost your follower base, go ahead and take up a trending challenge and post it on TikTok.

The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content-3"><a href="#Nature-of-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base-3"><a href="#User-Base-3" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach-3"><a href="#Outreach-3" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers-3"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos-3"><a href="#1-Music-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos-3"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about.

While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible.

Keep reading for their full take.</em></p><p> The promise of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the ultimate RPGs, a game that draws you into a complex, interwoven, living digital world where your decisions truly matter. In the eight years since its development was announced, an immense amount of anticipation has built up around this game, fueled by sky-high promises and too-good-to-be-true teasers. Unfortunately, Cyberpunk 2077, like Spore and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/no-mans-sky-tips-4117336" >No Man’s Sky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before it, falls short of the hype built up around it.</p><p> Look a little closer, and you may find a lot to love in this game, but it’s important to be aware of Cyberpunk 2077’s many flaws before deciding to jump into the immense and darkly beautiful dystopian metropolis that is Night City.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YQBwL9wFHphVzIqJYlYwd0J2OYU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-2-7e358ac09a2c48fbb0f6aaec1e9381e9.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993651%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993651/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139114/17108" target="_top" id="2139114">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139114" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139114/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Story-Engaging-and-well-written"><a href="#Story-Engaging-and-well-written" class="headerlink" title="Story: Engaging and well written"></a>Story: Engaging and well written</h2><p> You start out by choosing from one of several different life paths, each of which features a different intro, as well as unique dialogue options throughout the game. The Nomad starts in the wastelands, the Street Kid in the inner city, and the Corpo in what else but the heart of a mega corporation.</p><p> Once you get past the prologue you are let loose upon Night City, and from here the game progresses through various interconnected missions, both mandatory and optional. Because of this interconnected nature of the game, you may get a different outcome to the overarching story based on your decisions, both in main story missions and side quests. It can be rather daunting to be faced with so many potentially impactful decisions, and between this and the dense skill and ability customization system, this is one instance in which you might want to invest in a physical guide to the game.</p><p> As for the quality of the story itself, whatever path you choose is remarkably well written, and this quality of storytelling is probably the main highlight of the game, next to the insane graphical fidelity. It is well-acted, and some sequences are so well done that you can almost forget you’re playing a game, and it becomes more like an interactive movie. This is in part due to the innovative conversation system, which allows the player more agency while talking to NPCs. Unlike a lot of games, most conversations don’t lock you in and fix you in place until you excuse yourself, and it’s remarkable how natural it feels to talk to people in the game.</p><p> There is clearly a lot more polish put on the main story missions than on some other parts of the game, and if you follow it closely, the flaws of Cyberpunk 2077 don’t show quite so much. You get to experience the massive open world of Night City in a way that makes narrative sense and see the most exciting set-piece sequences. With that said, there are some really entertaining side stories to be found if you venture off the straight and narrow path of the main campaign.</p><p> Cyberpunk’s gameplay is very much a case of sharply contrasting highs and lows.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-but-deeply-flawed"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-but-deeply-flawed" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, but deeply flawed"></a>Gameplay: Fun, but deeply flawed</h2><p> As with the game as a whole, Cyberpunk’s gameplay is very much a case of sharply contrasting highs and lows. It does some things very well and stumbles bafflingly in other regards. The game mostly takes place in the first person, with third-person view being an option while driving.</p><p> Driving is not what I’d call a perfect experience in either third or first-person modes. Though beautifully designed and widely varied, vehicles tend to have little weight to them, and you really have to work to avoid careening about the road, running over pedestrians, and attracting the tepid attention of the police. They all also seem to be in desperate need of a new set of brakes, and to make matters worse the AI for the NPC vehicles is very simple indeed. Park your car with a bit of it sticking out into the road and a line will quickly build up as these simpletons exhibit infinite patience rather than simply go around.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NwK7qVv8XDmr_i0b9XzULnmPZ9Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-5-664cae2e38304560a7d6fc3ce2a84335.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The reason behind the driving issues seems to be largely an issue of perception, as they occur at high speeds, but unless you keep an eye on your speedometer it’s very difficult to judge how fast you’re going. I often found myself going over a hundred, but my mind said I was traveling at half that or less. It would be better for the sake of gameplay if your wheels stuck to the asphalt a bit better, and it wouldn’t really be that unrealistic, given that it is 2077 after all; it makes sense for cars to handle better than they do in 2020.</p><p> What can’t be explained away by an unwise dedication to realism is the behavior of NPCs. This simplicity of NPC AI is widespread throughout the game and a big letdown from what was promised. When I started out, I played very carefully, since the realistic looks and the promise of police response encouraged me to treat everyone with respect, like I was in a real living world. However, as time went on I came to view these automatons with even less consideration than the NPCs in other RPGs.</p><p> Their glitchy reactions are so at odds with their realistic looks that the end result is rather off-putting, so I began to regard them with pure disdain. Also, the fear of police response quickly fades once you realize that they won’t chase you for more than half a block, and once they lose sight of you they forget about you completely in short order. There are no consequences, no exciting spontaneous chase scenes, just a couple of dudes firing at you ineffectually with pistols.</p><p> Furthermore, there are no lasting consequences. Your friendly contact in the NCPD will still call you up and ask for help, and cops on the street won’t care that the world’s most prolific mass murderer just waltzed through the holographic police tape cordoning off their crime scene. By hour 15, the result of this failure of AI systems led to me to think nothing of stealing a car from the middle of a busy intersection and accidentally pinwheeling my out of control vehicle through a crowd of pedestrians before driving off into the sunset as two officers bounced rounds off my retreating bumper.</p><p> If you want to avoid conflict and don’t want to slow down for stupid drivers, your best bet is a motorcycle, and it is indeed a blast to go zipping through the streets dodging through gaps in traffic. For some reason, motorcycles control much more reliably than cars, and a cynical mind might suppose that more care was put into motorcycle control due to Cyberpunk featuring the brand of motorcycle owned by a major celebrity who plays a part in the game’s story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ByBdwophc_bSfdD-P0CfbqJgbwY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-7-e6be7e2c1ae24ac3a1c5dbfd4a5b595a.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135368/19272" target="_top" id="2135368">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135368" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135368/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> You can also use fast travel booths to get around instantly once you’ve unlocked them, though I found myself favoring the slow route, despite the issues inherent in that experience. Cruising through Night City is truly a jaw-dropping experience.</p><p> This contrast of “holy cow” moments with irritating design flaws continues with combat. In one of the first combat encounters of the game, you fight a dynamic battle in a small apartment that includes walls being ripped apart by gunfire. In another sequence, you fight a crazy cyborg with swords for arms as you race down the freeway. These scripted fights in the story are exciting and well-balanced.</p><p> However, stray from the areas of the world where your story is progressing, and you will meet higher-level enemies. They do more damage and have more strength, and also drop gear that you can’t equip until you level up. This makes sense on a technical level as it prevents the story missions from becoming imbalanced and too easy. The problem is that the enemies look little different from those you’ve fought in lower-level locations, and it really shatters immersion for a random thug with no armor or magic powers to take a dozen sniper rifle bullets to the head to kill. Again, this makes sense from a balancing perspective, but they could have figured out a more dynamic and natural way to scale difficulty throughout the game.</p><p> Other aspects of gameplay include hacking or netrunning as it is referred to in the game. This allows you to take control of various objects and even people, depending on your character build. It’s immensely helpful in tough fights to enter scanning mode, appraise the situation, and use your hacking skills to turn the tide of battle. With hacking, stealth skills, and non-lethal weaponry you can even go for no-kill run, though bugs, glitches, and AI issues may make the temptation to jump in, guns blazing, rather tempting.</p><p> It may sound as though I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, with as much complaining as I’m doing about gameplay, but the truth is that I had a blast despite the bugs. Driving through Night City is still exciting after dozens of hours, and I’m still finding new weapons that offer new ways to approach combat.</p><p> Driving out of a garage for the first time into a canyon of towering sci-fi skyscrapers bedecked in holograms and neon is one of those awe-inspiring moments that come only fleetingly in video games.</p><h2 id="Customization-Lots-to-tinker-with"><a href="#Customization-Lots-to-tinker-with" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots to tinker with"></a>Customization: Lots to tinker with</h2><p> There is a deep level of character customization possible in Cyberpunk 2077, and you can sink a lot of time into creating the perfect character. Of course, you can always just pick a preset, but where’s the fun in that? I tried to craft a likeness of Snake Plissken from Escape from Los Angeles, but couldn’t get it quite right, so I made a rough approximation of Basil Fawlty instead.</p><p> Next, you get seven points with which to customize your character’s attributes between body, intelligence, technical ability, and cool. This determines your proficiency in both physical and technical skills. Don’t worry too much, as you will level up and add to these attributes and their associated skills as the game progresses. Skills allow you to fine-tune your abilities, as well as add new ones to your arsenal. It’s a good idea to focus on a specialty, once you know what you enjoy doing in the game because the more points you put into a category the more options unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Uqy4AEm6VMUR3LFH9U2FK5UDvo0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-3-28901c5bd3564eeea8e98bc9dbb8ae07.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> Another area of customization is your cybernetic implants. These can affect everything from your netrunning skills to giving you swords and rocket launchers that pop out of your arms. You’ll need to visit a Ripperdoc to buy and install them, and they cost a pretty penny, so you’ll need to pull off a few jobs to afford them.</p><p> You can also clothe your character in whatever garments you find or buy around the game world. These affect your armor and other stats, though in a somewhat unintuitive fashion where a high-level cotton shirt may give you more armor than a low-level bulletproof vest. This goes for weapons as well, and I ended up going through weapons at a rapid pace as I acquired higher level ones.</p><p> Of course, if you get a weapon you can’t bear to part with you can upgrade it, and you will pick up legendary and epic gear that you will want to hold onto (including clothing). However, I found it to be a bit of a headache figuring out the crafting system, and you need to invest points in the necessary skills to do so.</p><p>At launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bug-riddled mess.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bugs-Welcome-to-Glitch-City"><a href="#Bugs-Welcome-to-Glitch-City" class="headerlink" title="Bugs: Welcome to Glitch City"></a>Bugs: Welcome to Glitch City</h2><p> At launch Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bug-riddled mess. Even a few months and a few patches later it’s very noticeably in need of major fixes. Right out of the gate I found a collectible card that can only be picked up during the intro, but the game refused to allow me to pick it up, so I was forced to leave it sitting there forlornly, forever gnawing at the completionist streak in me.</p><p> It bothered me even though I later found it wasn’t actually unique or important. Just after this, I drove past a dingy alley and glimpsed trash bags flying up into the air from the dumpster. Curious if it was some cyber-raccoon I investigated, but to no avail. It was only silent, motionless bags of trash, quietly minding their own business.</p><p> More game-breaking bugs lay deeper in the game. In one mission I entered a shooting competition, but the mission broke halfway through and locked me in the shooting range. Worse was a bug that rendered me unable to draw my weapons, and this persisted even after loading an earlier save. I ran aimlessly through the streets spamming the alt key until I injured a pedestrian with a car and got a warrant put out for my arrest. When this happened the screen flickered, and suddenly I was clutching an assault rifle. I felt like Ralphie from “A Christmas Story” opening up his Red Rider BB gun.</p><p> Other bugs I ran into included many instances of cars being fused together or spontaneously combusting. One particularly disturbing scene during a mission involved me materializing inside an NPC behind the wheel of a car so that I was staring in horror at the backs of her eyeballs, her detached jaw hanging in mid-air as hair floated like tentacles all about me.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JM3cD1pX6maee1yiQYZnSgc-9pw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-4-624da4fa8225434eb59ba999a53dafd6.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815679/21290" target="_top" id="1815679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815679/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mature-content-Pushing-the-boundaries"><a href="#Mature-content-Pushing-the-boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Mature content: Pushing the boundaries"></a>Mature content: Pushing the boundaries</h2><p> It must be mentioned that Cyberpunk 2077 earns its mature rating. Parents and players alike would do well to head the descriptors of that rating, as all of them are well deserved. There are options to ameliorate this in some respects, but only to a limited extent. The fact is that Cyberpunk 2077 is an imagining of a dark and disturbing future, and the game forces players to confront the consequences should humanity go down such a road.</p><p> The truth is that Cyberpunk is a role-playing game in the truest sense of the word. While you will never be able to completely dodge potentially offensive content, you can play the game in a way that reflects your own morality and ideals. A great example of this potential for choice is alcohol, which you will be proffered on numerous occasions throughout the game. Even though it is embedded into the story you almost always have the option to refuse, though as in real life the peer pressure is there and the choice may affect how people regard you.</p><p> The high quality of storytelling is probably the main highlight of the game, next to the insane graphical fidelity.</p><h2 id="Performance-Making-strong-GPUs-cry"><a href="#Performance-Making-strong-GPUs-cry" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Making strong GPUs cry"></a>Performance: Making strong GPUs cry</h2><p> Sometimes a game comes along that pushes the limits of what computer hardware is possible. This led to a whole generation of gamers growing up asking the classic question “Can it run Crysis?”. Cyberpunk 2077 is truly the Crysis of the modern day, and that means that at launch very few people will get to experience this game as intended. To get the most out of this game you really need a Nvidia RTX 3080, an expensive GPU that at the time of this writing is so scarce that really only a handful of people around the globe are getting the most out of Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p> With that said, don’t give up hope. PC gamers with last-gen GPUs can still eke out a good experience from this monster of a game. My rig made out pretty well with its RTX 2070, though it took a lot of time tweaking graphics options in order to balance looks with performance.</p><p> Running at 1080p I was able to max out many of the graphics options, though I had to make a few sacrifices. Interestingly, the infamously power-hungry ray tracing tech actually greatly improves performance here if your GPU is capable of it, this is thanks to the integration of DLSS which works with ray tracing to reduce the load on your GPU. You do trade a good deal of sharpness for this DLSS performance boost, but honestly, I find the grainy look to be appropriate for the grimy dystopia depicted in the game.</p><p> Even with my settings well-adjusted I still ran into occasional frame rate drops, particularly in areas with a lot of volumetric fog and many lighting sources. Traveling at high speeds also tested the limits of my gaming rig.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/toUXDFSRFZjol-BOgnhnVEyJTYw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-8-7b54b824c3bc4dcfb04234f69204d2f6.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> If you don’t have a ray tracing enabled card, you may want to think twice about Cyberpunk 2077 until you’re able to upgrade. It’s playable on older cards, but the incredible visuals of this game running on high-end hardware are such an integral part of the experience that it’s hard to recommend running in a reduced capacity. The same goes for last-gen consoles (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), where the experience is also greatly impacted by reduced processing power. Players are reporting the worst issues on these older consoles, where Cyberpunk appears to be almost unplayable for many.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may offer a more consistent experience (though not equivalent to high-end PC), but like 30 series Nvidia GPUs these devices are in high demand and short supply, and you won’t be free of bugs, glitches, and performance issues even there.</p><p> An alternative worth considering if you have a robust high-speed internet connection is streaming the game on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-stadia-review-4788032" >Google Stadia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This will allow you to experience the game at its best without having to invest in a two thousand dollar PC. However, it does leave your ability to play the game at the mercy of your ability to access a strong internet connection.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Ahead-of-its-time"><a href="#Graphics-Ahead-of-its-time" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Ahead of its time"></a>Graphics: Ahead of its time</h2><p> The star of the show in Cyberpunk 2077 are the visuals, and if you have a PC with the hardware to render the game at its maximum quality while maintaining playable frame rates the world of Night City is absolutely jaw-dropping. Driving out of a garage for the first time into a canyon of towering sci-fi skyscrapers bedecked in holograms and neon is one of those awe-inspiring moments that come only fleetingly in video games.</p><p> It may sound as though I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, with as much complaining as I’m doing about gameplay, but the truth is that I had a blast despite the bugs.</p><p> Everything is so finely detailed, from the lovingly rendered cars to the buildings to the cracked and filthy pavement beneath your feet it is incredible what CDPR has achieved here. Because of how sprawling, spectacular, and densely packed the game is, you can often put aside momentarily the game’s flaws and just admire the sheer scale of it all. Automotive enthusiasts will fall in love with the retro-futuristic design of cars in the game, though unfortunately, car customization is a feature that was pulled before release.</p><p> Character models are also remarkably lifelike, and when conversing with characters in the game it is amazing how little of the nefarious uncanny valley is present in them. However, as previously mentioned, I found that the realistic design of NPCs on the street clashes with their awful AI in a way that brings about an all new but no less awful incarnation of the uncanny valley. This isn’t a critique of the graphics so much as a mark against the buggy and incomplete state of the game.</p><p> One other criticism I have is not a slight against the graphics and is largely a matter of personal preference, but I can’t help but feel somewhat put off by the oppressive dystopian setting after putting many hours into the game. If anything, this is high praise for its realism, as CDPR has managed to realistically depict a dark future that is at times too real for comfort. It’s so grand in its decadent squalor that I can’t help be drawn back in.</p><p> One more thing that irritated me was the repetition of items and advertisements throughout the world. The many glowing holographic and neon advertisements seem to have maybe a dozen or so variations at most and are all rather unpleasant to look at. It’s just a little weird that the developers didn’t design a few more ads given how much unique handcrafted detail is in the rest of the game world.</p><p> Again, it’s important to note that most players won’t see this spectacular vision of Night City due to the demanding hardware requirements, and that is a shame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/o42yZx4igr8SBsJoS2Nc52n6m3U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-6-1b41a87ba1244122adf280147c09e5f1.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Multiplayer-Absent-for-the-moment"><a href="#Multiplayer-Absent-for-the-moment" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Absent for the moment"></a>Multiplayer: Absent for the moment</h2><p> At launch and for long after Cyberpunk 2077 will be a single-player game. However, CDPR has said that a few years down the road they will be launching a multiplayer mode, and a lot of people are looking forward to that. Of course, it is impossible to predict if this will be any good or if some circumstances might prevent its release, but there is a lot of potential for Cyberpunk to become a better experience when Night City goes online. With that said, CDPR really needs to fix the single-player game before they even think about launching multiplayer.</p><h2 id="Price-A-refreshing-lack-of-micro-transactions"><a href="#Price-A-refreshing-lack-of-micro-transactions" class="headerlink" title="Price: A refreshing lack of micro-transactions"></a>Price: A refreshing lack of micro-transactions</h2><p> At $60 with no extra monetization at launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bargain. Take this with a grain of salt though, as this situation could change dramatically once the multiplayer mode is released.</p><h2 id="Cyberpunk-2077-vs-Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla"><a href="#Cyberpunk-2077-vs-Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla" class="headerlink" title="Cyberpunk 2077 vs. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla"></a>Cyberpunk 2077 vs. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</h2><p> Though very different in setting, tone, and gameplay perspective,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a similarly vast open-world that launched not long before Cyberpunk 2077, and gamers may be split on which to dump a hundred or more hours of time into. At the time of writing, Valhalla is a much more polished and complete experience. Also, whereas the dystopia of Night City can be an oppressive environment to spend many hours exploring, the green hills of England in Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla offer an escapist experience.</p><p> It’s also impossible to avoid comparisons to<a class="link"   href="https://www.liveabout.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-cheats-3406136" >Grand Theft Auto <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which in many ways Cyberpunk 2077 bears more than a superficial resemblance to. When you get right down to it, Cyberpunk plays like a heavily modded GTA V with less humor, more bugs, and worse driving mechanics.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An open-world RPG with enormous potential that’s sadly incomplete and unpolished.</strong></p><p> Cyberpunk 2077 had enormous potential, but it launched long before it was complete and the result is a deeply conflicting experience. Game-breaking bugs, performance issues, missing features, and demanding hardware requirements make it difficult to recommend, but there is the core of something great lying within. There are hundreds of hours of content to enjoy if you can temper your expectations and employ a saintly degree of patience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896505/19272" target="_top" id="1896505">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896505" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896505/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Cyberpunk 2077</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  December 2020</li><li>Color  N&#x2F;A</li><li>Platforms  PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Stadia</li><li>Rating  M</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-android-and-iphone-the-ultimate-guide-to-saving-tiktok/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Android & iPhone The Ultimate Guide to Saving TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-parroting-perfection-dissecting-bebops-latest-flight-feature/"><u>[New] Parroting Perfection Dissecting Bebop's Latest Flight Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-who-are-the-kings-of-tiktok-gameplay-for-2024/"><u>[New] Who Are the Kings of TikTok Gameplay for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-make-a-ken-burns-effect-in-camtasia-9-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Make a Ken Burns Effect in Camtasia 9, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-bold-framing-integrating-large-headscapes-into-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Bold Framing Integrating Large Headscapes Into TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ticktock-wit-spotlight-on-top-tiktok-comedy-personalities/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, TickTock Wit Spotlight on Top TikTok Comedy Personalities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-top-15-innovative-tiktok-challenges-unveiled-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top 15 Innovative TikTok Challenges Unveiled for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crossing-the-line-guesting-in-friends-tiktok-shows/"><u>2024 Approved Crossing the Line Guesting in Friends' TikTok Shows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-efface-markings-iosandroid-apps-for-clear-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Efface Markings IOS/Android Apps for Clear Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/boosting-performance-win11-lenovo-thinkpad-drivers/"><u>Boosting Performance: Win11 Lenovo Thinkpad Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-realme-c67-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Detailed guide of ispoofer for pogo installation On Realme C67 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-webster.techidaily.com/effiziente-methoden-mehrfach-computer-synchronisation-mit-google-drive/"><u>Effiziente Methoden: Mehrfach-Computer-Synchronisation Mit Google Drive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-do-i-reset-my-vivo-y100a-phone-without-technical-knowledge-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How do I reset my Vivo Y100A Phone without technical knowledge?

Scheduled for March 19, the bare metal vs. raw power event is set to become a must-watch experience of the annual CloudFest conference.</p><p> According to the dedicated event page,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/39-year-old-477-mhz-dos-web-server-hits-2500-hours-of-uptime" >server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> throwing began in Holland about a decade ago and is an “intense underground sport, which has been criticized as ‘needlessly brutal to servers’.” This sport is now emerging from its data-center basement origins and is set to enter the world stage at CloudFest 2024.</p><p> CloudFest provides a few details regarding the 2024 World Server Throwing Championship. This outdoor event in front of a live audience will welcome “up to 40 server-throwing athletes.” All genders and ability levels are welcome to participate as long as they desire to throw a server a great distance. Every athlete will get two measured attempts at server throwing and will hope to be placed in the top three so they can win a prize.</p><p> Though the sport is brutal by its very nature, it is good to see that participants at previous events always wear gloves. Some servers have very sharp edges. If you plan to attend, it might be wise to stand behind participants rather than to the left or right in case of server hurling misjudgment.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> It isn’t clear if there are 1U, 2U, and 4U divisions, or, dare we say it, 8U for the real heavy lifters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtmZvaBCUd7W2J88EkoF6b-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Server throwing athletes"                ></p><p> (Image credit: CloudFest)</p><p> If we had to place a bet on the winner’s nationality, it would probably be Dutch, as the country where the sport seems to have become established. We discovered that some of the WTSC partners have already promoted server throwing in Dutch events. The winner of a Dutch national championship event<a class="link"   href="https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/agenda/summer-bbq-dutch-cloud-community-2022/" >in 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> managed to fling a 10kg+ (22 pounds +) server 12.23 meters (over 40 feet).</p><p> We think there is plenty of room for improvement on the 2022 winning throw. Remember, the world record distance for throwing a 16-pound shot put is nearly 75 feet. For another comparison, in the Swedish sport of Stångstörtning, a roughly 57-pound log is tossed, with the world record distance being 32 feet.
