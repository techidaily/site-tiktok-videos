Post a Video At Least Once Every Day"></a>1. Post a Video At Least Once Every Day</h3><p>The platform expects its successful creators to post videos often. In case you wish to go viral, you need to create enough content for people to notice you. If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.</p><p>The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality. So, upload at least one video every day.</p><h3 id="2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-the-Videos-are-of-High-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality"></a>2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality</h3><p>The importance of this cannot be emphasized enough. TikTok is all about trending videos. Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity. For this, however, you don’t have to employ a professional camera operator. You can create videos using your smartphone and then edit them using good software. This ensures that you make videos that will go viral. You can use an external microphone if the sound is an essential component.</p><h3 id="3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds"><a href="#3-Do-Not-Ignore-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Not Ignore Sounds"></a>3. Do Not Ignore Sounds</h3><p>One of the primary differences of TikTok has been the liberty that it gives you to use music in the videos that people are sharing. It is incredibly easy to add music to your 15-seconds video on this platform. TikTok has made arrangements with the top music companies to get permission to use the copyrighted music extracts.</p><p>You will be able to add music tracks to your videos without any hassle from the app itself.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends"><a href="#4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Trending Hashtags to Keep Up with the Trends"></a>4. Use Trending Hashtags to Keep Up with the Trends</h3><p>When you open the TikTok app and tap on the ‘Discover’ button present at the bottom, it is going to show the trending hashtags. It is better to emulate some posts which you see on the ‘Discover’ page if you want the videos to trend on TikTok.</p><p>The trending hashtags change on a regular basis and tend to be region-specific.</p><p>Making videos about frogs or bears might not be your thing, especially when you do not have access to either animal. So, you need to look for trending hashtags that will be more relevant to your audience.</p><h3 id="5-Showcase-Your-Skills-in-the-Video"><a href="#5-Showcase-Your-Skills-in-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="5. Showcase Your Skills in the Video"></a>5. Showcase Your Skills in the Video</h3><p>In case you are looking for content ideas for the videos, you should ask yourself the skill you have. Several Tiktokers create videos of them doing something that they are good at. This can be playing an instrument, skateboarding, or playing a sport like fire-eating or juggling. There are many dancers that showcase their skills in lip-sync videos. Hence, you need to recognize your skill and use it to make your videos.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>To make your videos stand out from the rest, you should <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download FilmoraX on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and use it to edit your videos. The software comes with different effects and features that you can use to make your videos go viral. You don’t it for free on your device and start using it immediately.</p><p>Do not underestimate TikTok’s importance. The audience might be predominantly young, but it is aging with the platform. Hence, there are a considerable number of them. In case you are able to create trending videos, you can take it to be a notable success.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-step-by-step-process-to-upgrade-and-update-video-covers-on-social-media/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved A Step-by-Step Process to Upgrade and Update Video Covers on Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-art-of-crafting-a-one-of-a-kind-tiktok-marker/"><u>[New] The Art of Crafting a One-of-a-Kind TikTok Marker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-compelling-podcast-imagery-fundamental-tips/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Compelling Podcast Imagery Fundamental Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-entering-a-friends-tiktok-live-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[Updated] Entering a Friend's TikTok Live A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-beam-into-a-tiktok-live-your-seamless-integration-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Beam Into a TikTok Live Your Seamless Integration Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ethical-and-safe-tiktok-following-hacks/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Ethical and Safe TikTok Following Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-gamers-choice-best-4k-monitors/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top Gamer's Choice Best 4K Monitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/forgot-your-apple-id-password-and-email-on-iphone-13-pro-heres-the-best-fixes-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Forgot Your Apple ID Password and Email On iPhone 13 Pro?

Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.</p><p>Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.</p><p>Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?"></a>Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</h2><p>In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068412/7443" target="_top" id="2068412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version"><a href="#Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version"></a>Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version</h4><p>First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="latest version tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording a Video"></a>Step 2: Start Recording a Video</h4><p>Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘<strong>Done</strong>’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png"                      alt="enter text tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech"></a>Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech</h4><p>When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png"                      alt="tap-text-to speech tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally"><a href="#Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Save the Video Locally"></a>Step 5: Save the Video Locally</h4><p>It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “<strong>Save to Device</strong>” option is active and you can post it privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="save-to device tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers"><a href="#Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers"></a>Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers</h4><p>Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave"><a href="#Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave"></a>Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave</h4><p>Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok"><a href="#Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok"></a>Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok</h4><p>Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits. You will get a TikTok video with a customized text-to-speech voice for all intents and purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="upload video tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144274/7443" target="_top" id="2144274">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144274" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144274/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Customize-the-Text-To-Speech-Voice-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Customize-the-Text-To-Speech-Voice-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the powerful and easy-to-use video editing software that lets content creators empower the story and be amazed at results, no matter the skill level.

The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4.

This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

The drawback, though, it displays tons of ads, which can be pretty annoying.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1883998/19272" target="_top" id="1883998">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1883998" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1883998/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Celebrity-Voice-Changer-Parody"><a href="#2-Celebrity-Voice-Changer-Parody" class="headerlink" title="2.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915830/19272" target="_top" id="1915830">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915830" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915830/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531882">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531882">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531882%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531882/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118320/7443" target="_top" id="2118320">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118320" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118320/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos"></a>Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos</h2><p>With increasing competition among TikTok users, it is important to use a powerful video editing tool to make your TikTok videos stand out.

Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, TikTok became one of the fastest-growing apps on both the App Store and Google Play. Teenagers are obsessed with it, but their parents don’t understand it. The government fears it, but companies eager to make money off it. TikTok probably has been the most controversial (and prevalent) social network ever.</p><p>What makes TikTok different? Initially, Tiktok is famous for its 15-second short videos, and most of the videos are lip-syncing videos. Gradually, it evolved into a community mixed with music, lip-syncing, and micro-video content. Besides providing access to an impressive music library, the app also offers a rich selection of video editing tools, which makes videos go viral quickly.</p><p>However, the US government has threatened to ban TikTok in the US recently after it had been banned in India. The growing uncertainties of TikTok has driven so many users to look for <strong>TikTok alternatives</strong>. In this article, we will go through some of the best options available to both iPhone and Android users.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Dubsmash</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Funimate</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Cheez</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Triller</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Likee</a></li></ul><h2 id="Top-5-Alternatives-to-the-TikTok-App"><a href="#Top-5-Alternatives-to-the-TikTok-App" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Alternatives to the TikTok App"></a>Top 5 Alternatives to the TikTok App</h2><p>Members of TikTok - including the Musical.ly community can’t create videos longer than one minute, which can potentially limit their options while recording music videos. What’s more, the app’s video editing capabilities are somewhat limited, since producing the cloning effect and numerous other effects require you to use more powerful video editing apps. To help you overcome these obstacles, we’ve selected some of the best music video apps on the market, so here are the five best <strong>alternatives to TikTok</strong>.</p><h4 id="1-Dubsmash"><a href="#1-Dubsmash" class="headerlink" title="1. Dubsmash"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dubsmash/id918820076?mt=8" >Dubsmash <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dubsmash.png"                      alt="Dubsmash"                ></p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>It is probably one of the oldest music video apps for Android and iOS-based devices that lost a bit of its former glory with the rise of Musical.ly. The fact that Dubmash has over one hundred million installs speaks volumes about its popularity today. By downloading this app, you’re becoming a part of a large community that revolves around entertaining lip-sync videos.</p><p>You can use thousands of different sounds in your videos, including movie and TV quotes, which means that you’ll always have fresh material for your videos. The app lets you add stickers and text overlays to videos so that you can make even more captivating music videos. The app displays videos in the style of Snapchat stories divided into two news feed sections so you can follow the channels you like and keep track of the latest videos posted by your friends. Besides enabling you to post music videos on your Dumbmash profile, the app lets you share your videos on other social media networks. You can save each video you produce with this app to your camera roll.</p><p>Can you believe it? Lots of movie stars are big fans of this app and Penelope Cruz is one of them.</p><h4 id="2-Funimate"><a href="#2-Funimate" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can create slow-motion videos, compile several video clips into a compilation, make video loops, and much more. The app’s huge music library grants you access to countless popular songs and sound effects, which makes it a perfect choice for lip-syncing videos.</p><p>Funimate features more than twenty advanced video effects that turn ordinary everyday moments into magical viral music videos. In addition, you can add as much text or stickers to a video as you want, so you can easily add funny comments to each video you record with this app. Making collab videos with your friends is comfortable with Funimate as you have to pick a song you both like and merge the footage into a single clip.

However, it gives unprecedented results for your TikTok account and posted videos. What you need to do is, at the end of the post (or in the middle also), you need to put some valuable hashtags (the symbol “# followed by a short text without space”), which tells about your video genre. So, whenever any user clicks on the particular hashtags, those users will directly be able to see your video content, media file, or will get directed to your content area. Thus, giving your post a boost. Hence this is how to get views on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Tip-2-Actively-involved-At-least-one-post-per-day"><a href="#Tip-2-Actively-involved-At-least-one-post-per-day" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day"></a>Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day</h4><p>You must be aware of the idea of activeness. Whoever remains active wins the race. The fact behind is, if you actively engage in posting the content over your TikTok account, then the users will feel the sense of connection, and the chain reaction will increase the size of followers day by day.</p><p>Further, be consistent in posting at least one post per day. It will reflect your keen interest in the TikTok profile.</p><h4 id="Tip-3-‘For-You’-page"><a href="#Tip-3-‘For-You’-page" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: ‘For You’ page"></a>Tip 3: ‘For You’ page</h4><p>Another valuable trick is to involve&#x2F;include the front page, ‘For You’ page for the users. It will direct and suggest the users’ relevant link, content, or video of their interests according to their search history. So, when any user lands on your page, they will get the content of interest, enhancing their chances of revisiting your profile. Also, you will get an idea of what is the most liked video on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Tip-4-Collaborate-with-your-friends"><a href="#Tip-4-Collaborate-with-your-friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends"></a>Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends</h4><p>Preparing a video or media for the TikTok profile is a good idea, but posting some exciting content along with your friend is a beautiful idea.

So better be involved with them as much as possible. Actively write comments, so whenever a user visits your profile, they see that you write comments regularly, and most probably revert to your account or profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/communicate-with-tiktok-users.jpg"                      alt="Communicate with Tiktok Users"                ></p><p>Image Source: capitalfm.com</p><h4 id="Tip-6-You-profile-must-be-complete"><a href="#Tip-6-You-profile-must-be-complete" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: You profile must be complete"></a>Tip 6: You profile must be complete</h4><p>In my opinion, this is a very crucial tip to keep your profile up-to-date all the time.

TikTok now seems to be a part of everyone’s life through the most popular lip-syncing videos, one-act dance routines, 1-min recipes, funny clips, and stuff like the bottle cap challenge.</p><p>More or less the heart and soul of today’s teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World’s 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.</p><p>What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one’s talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom.

The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123750/7443" target="_top" id="2123750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123750/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!</p><h4 id="3-Calming-Videos"><a href="#3-Calming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Calming Videos"></a>3. Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4. Objects Singing Videos</h4><p>One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.</p><p>See if <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1079418894538940418" >Pikachu and his orchestra can provide you with some inspiration <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Art-Videos"><a href="#5-Art-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5.

This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run.

While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible. Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.
