This trend started on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and has spread to other social media like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. TikTok has already conquered the Asian market, but in recent years this video-sharing and social networking app is becoming popular across the globe.</p><p>Standing out from TikTok isn’t as easy as you thought, because you will face fierce competition, and you must do everything you can to improve the quality of the content you share on TikTok. So, in this article, we will look at the best TikTok video editing apps that will enable you to produce content that attracts millions of viewers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-TikTok’s-Built-in-Video-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools"></a>How to Use the TikTok’s Built-in Video Editing Tools</h2><p>In addition to viewing the content posted by other TikTok users, the app lets you record and edit videos. The video editing tools you are going to have at your disposal are basic but still powerful enough to enable you to enhance the 15 and 60-second videos you capture with TikTok.</p><p>To start making a new video, you have to tap on the + icon that is located at the bottom of the app’s home screen and then tap on the red Video button on the app’s Shooting page. Before you start recording, tap on the Add a Sound option if you would like to choose a song or an audio effect you would like to add to a video you’re creating.</p><p>Adding Texts in TikTok Video with TikTok: By Rhia</p><p>Moreover, the app lets you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >control the video’s playback speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, apply filters and effects or activate the Beauty mode before you start shooting. As we already noted, a video you record with TikTok cannot be longer than 60 seconds. Hence, after you capture your comedy sketch or create a music video, you’ll be able to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply stickers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voice or sound effects, filters, and visual effects or add <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >text layers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Each video you create with TikTok is different, which means that you have to try out different options in order to get the most out of the footage you record with this app. In addition, you can trim videos that are longer than 15 seconds and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adjust the volume <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of a video’s original sound or the volume of its soundtrack.</p><p>The set of video and audio editing tools TikTok app provides can limit your options during the video editing process, but you can easily solve this issue by tapping on the Upload button that is located in the bottom right corner of the Shooting page.</p><p>This option enables you to use a video editing app that offers more advanced video editing tools to polish your videos before you upload them to TikTok. Once you are done editing, you can proceed to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add the description of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose if you want to enable comments, reactions, or give your followers the option to create duets.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Creating-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos"></a>Best Video Editing Apps for Creating TikTok Videos</h2><p>The video editing options TikTok offers are not versatile enough to allow you to perform complex video editing tasks. That is why a growing number of TikTok’s users opt for third-party apps that are equipped with the tools they can use to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >improve the quality of the content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they share on this social network. Here are some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing apps you can use on iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Android devices, as well as Mac and PC computers to create videos you share on TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#imovie">1. iMovie</a></li><li><a href="#adobe">2.

If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.</p><p>The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality.

Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity.

It is incredibly easy to add music to your 15-seconds video on this platform. TikTok has made arrangements with the top music companies to get permission to use the copyrighted music extracts.</p><p>You will be able to add music tracks to your videos without any hassle from the app itself.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends"><a href="#4-Use-Trending-Hashtags-to-Keep-Up-with-the-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4.

There are many dancers that showcase their skills in lip-sync videos. Hence, you need to recognize your skill and use it to make your videos.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>To make your videos stand out from the rest, you should <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download FilmoraX on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and use it to edit your videos.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148647/16836" target="_top" id="2148647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148647/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

Many Hyper Scape players managed to fix the crashing by verifying their game files. Here’s how to exactly do it:</p><ol><li>In Uplay, click the<strong>Games</strong> tab at the top of the window</li><li>Hover over the game tile of your Hyper Scape. This will make a little arrow appear at the bottom right of the tile</li><li>Click on this arrow and click on<strong>Verify files</strong> from the drop-down menu.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Verify-game-files.jpg"                      alt="Hyper Scape verify game files"                ></li><li>It will take about 3-5 minutes to verify your game files. Once complete, try playing Hyper Scape again to test the issue.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify-your-game-files.jpg"                      alt="verify your game files"                ></li></ol><p> If it helps you restore some missing&#x2F;corrupted game files, you can play the game without any crashing now.

Here’s how to run your game as an administrator permanently.</p><ol><li>Go to the folder<a class="link"   href="https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000038997" >where your game is installed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br> Eg.<strong><code>C:Ubisoft Game LaunchergamesHyper Scape</code></strong></li><li>Right-click<strong>Hyperscape</strong> executable file, and select<strong>Properties</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Properties.jpg"                                     ></li><li>Go to the<strong>Compatibility</strong> tab, and check<strong>Run this program as an administrator.</strong> Then click<strong>Apply &gt; OK</strong> to save the changes.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144282/7443" target="_top" id="2144282">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144282" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144282/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-as-admin.jpg"                      alt="run Hyper Scape as admin"                ><br>4.

Keep reading for their full take.</em></p><p> The promise of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the ultimate RPGs, a game that draws you into a complex, interwoven, living digital world where your decisions truly matter. In the eight years since its development was announced, an immense amount of anticipation has built up around this game, fueled by sky-high promises and too-good-to-be-true teasers. Unfortunately, Cyberpunk 2077, like Spore and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/no-mans-sky-tips-4117336" >No Man’s Sky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before it, falls short of the hype built up around it.</p><p> Look a little closer, and you may find a lot to love in this game, but it’s important to be aware of Cyberpunk 2077’s many flaws before deciding to jump into the immense and darkly beautiful dystopian metropolis that is Night City.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YQBwL9wFHphVzIqJYlYwd0J2OYU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-2-7e358ac09a2c48fbb0f6aaec1e9381e9.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Story-Engaging-and-well-written"><a href="#Story-Engaging-and-well-written" class="headerlink" title="Story: Engaging and well written"></a>Story: Engaging and well written</h2><p> You start out by choosing from one of several different life paths, each of which features a different intro, as well as unique dialogue options throughout the game. The Nomad starts in the wastelands, the Street Kid in the inner city, and the Corpo in what else but the heart of a mega corporation.</p><p> Once you get past the prologue you are let loose upon Night City, and from here the game progresses through various interconnected missions, both mandatory and optional. Because of this interconnected nature of the game, you may get a different outcome to the overarching story based on your decisions, both in main story missions and side quests. It can be rather daunting to be faced with so many potentially impactful decisions, and between this and the dense skill and ability customization system, this is one instance in which you might want to invest in a physical guide to the game.</p><p> As for the quality of the story itself, whatever path you choose is remarkably well written, and this quality of storytelling is probably the main highlight of the game, next to the insane graphical fidelity. It is well-acted, and some sequences are so well done that you can almost forget you’re playing a game, and it becomes more like an interactive movie. This is in part due to the innovative conversation system, which allows the player more agency while talking to NPCs. Unlike a lot of games, most conversations don’t lock you in and fix you in place until you excuse yourself, and it’s remarkable how natural it feels to talk to people in the game.</p><p> There is clearly a lot more polish put on the main story missions than on some other parts of the game, and if you follow it closely, the flaws of Cyberpunk 2077 don’t show quite so much. You get to experience the massive open world of Night City in a way that makes narrative sense and see the most exciting set-piece sequences. With that said, there are some really entertaining side stories to be found if you venture off the straight and narrow path of the main campaign.</p><p> Cyberpunk’s gameplay is very much a case of sharply contrasting highs and lows.</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-but-deeply-flawed"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-but-deeply-flawed" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, but deeply flawed"></a>Gameplay: Fun, but deeply flawed</h2><p> As with the game as a whole, Cyberpunk’s gameplay is very much a case of sharply contrasting highs and lows. It does some things very well and stumbles bafflingly in other regards. The game mostly takes place in the first person, with third-person view being an option while driving.</p><p> Driving is not what I’d call a perfect experience in either third or first-person modes. Though beautifully designed and widely varied, vehicles tend to have little weight to them, and you really have to work to avoid careening about the road, running over pedestrians, and attracting the tepid attention of the police. They all also seem to be in desperate need of a new set of brakes, and to make matters worse the AI for the NPC vehicles is very simple indeed. Park your car with a bit of it sticking out into the road and a line will quickly build up as these simpletons exhibit infinite patience rather than simply go around.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NwK7qVv8XDmr_i0b9XzULnmPZ9Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-5-664cae2e38304560a7d6fc3ce2a84335.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484944/16446" target="_top" id="1484944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484944/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The reason behind the driving issues seems to be largely an issue of perception, as they occur at high speeds, but unless you keep an eye on your speedometer it’s very difficult to judge how fast you’re going. I often found myself going over a hundred, but my mind said I was traveling at half that or less. It would be better for the sake of gameplay if your wheels stuck to the asphalt a bit better, and it wouldn’t really be that unrealistic, given that it is 2077 after all; it makes sense for cars to handle better than they do in 2020.</p><p> What can’t be explained away by an unwise dedication to realism is the behavior of NPCs. This simplicity of NPC AI is widespread throughout the game and a big letdown from what was promised. When I started out, I played very carefully, since the realistic looks and the promise of police response encouraged me to treat everyone with respect, like I was in a real living world. However, as time went on I came to view these automatons with even less consideration than the NPCs in other RPGs.</p><p> Their glitchy reactions are so at odds with their realistic looks that the end result is rather off-putting, so I began to regard them with pure disdain. Also, the fear of police response quickly fades once you realize that they won’t chase you for more than half a block, and once they lose sight of you they forget about you completely in short order. There are no consequences, no exciting spontaneous chase scenes, just a couple of dudes firing at you ineffectually with pistols.</p><p> Furthermore, there are no lasting consequences. Your friendly contact in the NCPD will still call you up and ask for help, and cops on the street won’t care that the world’s most prolific mass murderer just waltzed through the holographic police tape cordoning off their crime scene. By hour 15, the result of this failure of AI systems led to me to think nothing of stealing a car from the middle of a busy intersection and accidentally pinwheeling my out of control vehicle through a crowd of pedestrians before driving off into the sunset as two officers bounced rounds off my retreating bumper.</p><p> If you want to avoid conflict and don’t want to slow down for stupid drivers, your best bet is a motorcycle, and it is indeed a blast to go zipping through the streets dodging through gaps in traffic. For some reason, motorcycles control much more reliably than cars, and a cynical mind might suppose that more care was put into motorcycle control due to Cyberpunk featuring the brand of motorcycle owned by a major celebrity who plays a part in the game’s story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ByBdwophc_bSfdD-P0CfbqJgbwY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-7-e6be7e2c1ae24ac3a1c5dbfd4a5b595a.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> You can also use fast travel booths to get around instantly once you’ve unlocked them, though I found myself favoring the slow route, despite the issues inherent in that experience. Cruising through Night City is truly a jaw-dropping experience.</p><p> This contrast of “holy cow” moments with irritating design flaws continues with combat. In one of the first combat encounters of the game, you fight a dynamic battle in a small apartment that includes walls being ripped apart by gunfire. In another sequence, you fight a crazy cyborg with swords for arms as you race down the freeway. These scripted fights in the story are exciting and well-balanced.</p><p> However, stray from the areas of the world where your story is progressing, and you will meet higher-level enemies. They do more damage and have more strength, and also drop gear that you can’t equip until you level up. This makes sense on a technical level as it prevents the story missions from becoming imbalanced and too easy. The problem is that the enemies look little different from those you’ve fought in lower-level locations, and it really shatters immersion for a random thug with no armor or magic powers to take a dozen sniper rifle bullets to the head to kill. Again, this makes sense from a balancing perspective, but they could have figured out a more dynamic and natural way to scale difficulty throughout the game.</p><p> Other aspects of gameplay include hacking or netrunning as it is referred to in the game. This allows you to take control of various objects and even people, depending on your character build. It’s immensely helpful in tough fights to enter scanning mode, appraise the situation, and use your hacking skills to turn the tide of battle. With hacking, stealth skills, and non-lethal weaponry you can even go for no-kill run, though bugs, glitches, and AI issues may make the temptation to jump in, guns blazing, rather tempting.</p><p> It may sound as though I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, with as much complaining as I’m doing about gameplay, but the truth is that I had a blast despite the bugs. Driving through Night City is still exciting after dozens of hours, and I’m still finding new weapons that offer new ways to approach combat.</p><p> Driving out of a garage for the first time into a canyon of towering sci-fi skyscrapers bedecked in holograms and neon is one of those awe-inspiring moments that come only fleetingly in video games.</p><h2 id="Customization-Lots-to-tinker-with"><a href="#Customization-Lots-to-tinker-with" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots to tinker with"></a>Customization: Lots to tinker with</h2><p> There is a deep level of character customization possible in Cyberpunk 2077, and you can sink a lot of time into creating the perfect character. Of course, you can always just pick a preset, but where’s the fun in that? I tried to craft a likeness of Snake Plissken from Escape from Los Angeles, but couldn’t get it quite right, so I made a rough approximation of Basil Fawlty instead.</p><p> Next, you get seven points with which to customize your character’s attributes between body, intelligence, technical ability, and cool. This determines your proficiency in both physical and technical skills. Don’t worry too much, as you will level up and add to these attributes and their associated skills as the game progresses. Skills allow you to fine-tune your abilities, as well as add new ones to your arsenal. It’s a good idea to focus on a specialty, once you know what you enjoy doing in the game because the more points you put into a category the more options unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Uqy4AEm6VMUR3LFH9U2FK5UDvo0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-3-28901c5bd3564eeea8e98bc9dbb8ae07.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> Another area of customization is your cybernetic implants. These can affect everything from your netrunning skills to giving you swords and rocket launchers that pop out of your arms. You’ll need to visit a Ripperdoc to buy and install them, and they cost a pretty penny, so you’ll need to pull off a few jobs to afford them.</p><p> You can also clothe your character in whatever garments you find or buy around the game world. These affect your armor and other stats, though in a somewhat unintuitive fashion where a high-level cotton shirt may give you more armor than a low-level bulletproof vest. This goes for weapons as well, and I ended up going through weapons at a rapid pace as I acquired higher level ones.</p><p> Of course, if you get a weapon you can’t bear to part with you can upgrade it, and you will pick up legendary and epic gear that you will want to hold onto (including clothing). However, I found it to be a bit of a headache figuring out the crafting system, and you need to invest points in the necessary skills to do so.</p><p>At launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bug-riddled mess.</p><h2 id="Bugs-Welcome-to-Glitch-City"><a href="#Bugs-Welcome-to-Glitch-City" class="headerlink" title="Bugs: Welcome to Glitch City"></a>Bugs: Welcome to Glitch City</h2><p> At launch Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bug-riddled mess. Even a few months and a few patches later it’s very noticeably in need of major fixes. Right out of the gate I found a collectible card that can only be picked up during the intro, but the game refused to allow me to pick it up, so I was forced to leave it sitting there forlornly, forever gnawing at the completionist streak in me.</p><p> It bothered me even though I later found it wasn’t actually unique or important. Just after this, I drove past a dingy alley and glimpsed trash bags flying up into the air from the dumpster. Curious if it was some cyber-raccoon I investigated, but to no avail. It was only silent, motionless bags of trash, quietly minding their own business.</p><p> More game-breaking bugs lay deeper in the game. In one mission I entered a shooting competition, but the mission broke halfway through and locked me in the shooting range. Worse was a bug that rendered me unable to draw my weapons, and this persisted even after loading an earlier save. I ran aimlessly through the streets spamming the alt key until I injured a pedestrian with a car and got a warrant put out for my arrest. When this happened the screen flickered, and suddenly I was clutching an assault rifle. I felt like Ralphie from “A Christmas Story” opening up his Red Rider BB gun.</p><p> Other bugs I ran into included many instances of cars being fused together or spontaneously combusting. One particularly disturbing scene during a mission involved me materializing inside an NPC behind the wheel of a car so that I was staring in horror at the backs of her eyeballs, her detached jaw hanging in mid-air as hair floated like tentacles all about me.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JM3cD1pX6maee1yiQYZnSgc-9pw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-4-624da4fa8225434eb59ba999a53dafd6.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Mature-content-Pushing-the-boundaries"><a href="#Mature-content-Pushing-the-boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Mature content: Pushing the boundaries"></a>Mature content: Pushing the boundaries</h2><p> It must be mentioned that Cyberpunk 2077 earns its mature rating. Parents and players alike would do well to head the descriptors of that rating, as all of them are well deserved. There are options to ameliorate this in some respects, but only to a limited extent. The fact is that Cyberpunk 2077 is an imagining of a dark and disturbing future, and the game forces players to confront the consequences should humanity go down such a road.</p><p> The truth is that Cyberpunk is a role-playing game in the truest sense of the word. While you will never be able to completely dodge potentially offensive content, you can play the game in a way that reflects your own morality and ideals. A great example of this potential for choice is alcohol, which you will be proffered on numerous occasions throughout the game. Even though it is embedded into the story you almost always have the option to refuse, though as in real life the peer pressure is there and the choice may affect how people regard you.</p><p> The high quality of storytelling is probably the main highlight of the game, next to the insane graphical fidelity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030129/11832" target="_top" id="1030129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030129/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Making-strong-GPUs-cry"><a href="#Performance-Making-strong-GPUs-cry" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Making strong GPUs cry"></a>Performance: Making strong GPUs cry</h2><p> Sometimes a game comes along that pushes the limits of what computer hardware is possible. This led to a whole generation of gamers growing up asking the classic question “Can it run Crysis?”. Cyberpunk 2077 is truly the Crysis of the modern day, and that means that at launch very few people will get to experience this game as intended. To get the most out of this game you really need a Nvidia RTX 3080, an expensive GPU that at the time of this writing is so scarce that really only a handful of people around the globe are getting the most out of Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p> With that said, don’t give up hope. PC gamers with last-gen GPUs can still eke out a good experience from this monster of a game. My rig made out pretty well with its RTX 2070, though it took a lot of time tweaking graphics options in order to balance looks with performance.</p><p> Running at 1080p I was able to max out many of the graphics options, though I had to make a few sacrifices. Interestingly, the infamously power-hungry ray tracing tech actually greatly improves performance here if your GPU is capable of it, this is thanks to the integration of DLSS which works with ray tracing to reduce the load on your GPU. You do trade a good deal of sharpness for this DLSS performance boost, but honestly, I find the grainy look to be appropriate for the grimy dystopia depicted in the game.</p><p> Even with my settings well-adjusted I still ran into occasional frame rate drops, particularly in areas with a lot of volumetric fog and many lighting sources. Traveling at high speeds also tested the limits of my gaming rig.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/toUXDFSRFZjol-BOgnhnVEyJTYw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-8-7b54b824c3bc4dcfb04234f69204d2f6.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> If you don’t have a ray tracing enabled card, you may want to think twice about Cyberpunk 2077 until you’re able to upgrade. It’s playable on older cards, but the incredible visuals of this game running on high-end hardware are such an integral part of the experience that it’s hard to recommend running in a reduced capacity. The same goes for last-gen consoles (<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), where the experience is also greatly impacted by reduced processing power. Players are reporting the worst issues on these older consoles, where Cyberpunk appears to be almost unplayable for many.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may offer a more consistent experience (though not equivalent to high-end PC), but like 30 series Nvidia GPUs these devices are in high demand and short supply, and you won’t be free of bugs, glitches, and performance issues even there.</p><p> An alternative worth considering if you have a robust high-speed internet connection is streaming the game on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-stadia-review-4788032" >Google Stadia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This will allow you to experience the game at its best without having to invest in a two thousand dollar PC. However, it does leave your ability to play the game at the mercy of your ability to access a strong internet connection.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111967/7443" target="_top" id="2111967">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111967" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111967/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Ahead-of-its-time"><a href="#Graphics-Ahead-of-its-time" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Ahead of its time"></a>Graphics: Ahead of its time</h2><p> The star of the show in Cyberpunk 2077 are the visuals, and if you have a PC with the hardware to render the game at its maximum quality while maintaining playable frame rates the world of Night City is absolutely jaw-dropping. Driving out of a garage for the first time into a canyon of towering sci-fi skyscrapers bedecked in holograms and neon is one of those awe-inspiring moments that come only fleetingly in video games.</p><p> It may sound as though I hated playing Cyberpunk 2077, with as much complaining as I’m doing about gameplay, but the truth is that I had a blast despite the bugs.</p><p> Everything is so finely detailed, from the lovingly rendered cars to the buildings to the cracked and filthy pavement beneath your feet it is incredible what CDPR has achieved here. Because of how sprawling, spectacular, and densely packed the game is, you can often put aside momentarily the game’s flaws and just admire the sheer scale of it all. Automotive enthusiasts will fall in love with the retro-futuristic design of cars in the game, though unfortunately, car customization is a feature that was pulled before release.</p><p> Character models are also remarkably lifelike, and when conversing with characters in the game it is amazing how little of the nefarious uncanny valley is present in them. However, as previously mentioned, I found that the realistic design of NPCs on the street clashes with their awful AI in a way that brings about an all new but no less awful incarnation of the uncanny valley. This isn’t a critique of the graphics so much as a mark against the buggy and incomplete state of the game.</p><p> One other criticism I have is not a slight against the graphics and is largely a matter of personal preference, but I can’t help but feel somewhat put off by the oppressive dystopian setting after putting many hours into the game. If anything, this is high praise for its realism, as CDPR has managed to realistically depict a dark future that is at times too real for comfort. It’s so grand in its decadent squalor that I can’t help be drawn back in.</p><p> One more thing that irritated me was the repetition of items and advertisements throughout the world. The many glowing holographic and neon advertisements seem to have maybe a dozen or so variations at most and are all rather unpleasant to look at. It’s just a little weird that the developers didn’t design a few more ads given how much unique handcrafted detail is in the rest of the game world.</p><p> Again, it’s important to note that most players won’t see this spectacular vision of Night City due to the demanding hardware requirements, and that is a shame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/o42yZx4igr8SBsJoS2Nc52n6m3U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cyberpunk-2077-6-1b41a87ba1244122adf280147c09e5f1.jpg"                      alt="Cyberpunk 2077"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100534/7443" target="_top" id="2100534">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100534" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100534/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Andy Zahn &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Multiplayer-Absent-for-the-moment"><a href="#Multiplayer-Absent-for-the-moment" class="headerlink" title="Multiplayer: Absent for the moment"></a>Multiplayer: Absent for the moment</h2><p> At launch and for long after Cyberpunk 2077 will be a single-player game. However, CDPR has said that a few years down the road they will be launching a multiplayer mode, and a lot of people are looking forward to that. Of course, it is impossible to predict if this will be any good or if some circumstances might prevent its release, but there is a lot of potential for Cyberpunk to become a better experience when Night City goes online. With that said, CDPR really needs to fix the single-player game before they even think about launching multiplayer.</p><h2 id="Price-A-refreshing-lack-of-micro-transactions"><a href="#Price-A-refreshing-lack-of-micro-transactions" class="headerlink" title="Price: A refreshing lack of micro-transactions"></a>Price: A refreshing lack of micro-transactions</h2><p> At $60 with no extra monetization at launch, Cyberpunk 2077 is something of a bargain. Take this with a grain of salt though, as this situation could change dramatically once the multiplayer mode is released.</p><h2 id="Cyberpunk-2077-vs-Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla"><a href="#Cyberpunk-2077-vs-Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla" class="headerlink" title="Cyberpunk 2077 vs. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla"></a>Cyberpunk 2077 vs. Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</h2><p> Though very different in setting, tone, and gameplay perspective,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a similarly vast open-world that launched not long before Cyberpunk 2077, and gamers may be split on which to dump a hundred or more hours of time into. At the time of writing, Valhalla is a much more polished and complete experience. Also, whereas the dystopia of Night City can be an oppressive environment to spend many hours exploring, the green hills of England in Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla offer an escapist experience.</p><p> It’s also impossible to avoid comparisons to<a class="link"   href="https://www.liveabout.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-cheats-3406136" >Grand Theft Auto <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which in many ways Cyberpunk 2077 bears more than a superficial resemblance to. When you get right down to it, Cyberpunk plays like a heavily modded GTA V with less humor, more bugs, and worse driving mechanics.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An open-world RPG with enormous potential that’s sadly incomplete and unpolished.</strong></p><p> Cyberpunk 2077 had enormous potential, but it launched long before it was complete and the result is a deeply conflicting experience. Game-breaking bugs, performance issues, missing features, and demanding hardware requirements make it difficult to recommend, but there is the core of something great lying within. There are hundreds of hours of content to enjoy if you can temper your expectations and employ a saintly degree of patience.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Cyberpunk 2077</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  December 2020</li><li>Color  N&#x2F;A</li><li>Platforms  PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Stadia</li><li>Rating  M</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-maximizing-impact-with-a-triad-of-tailored-copywriting-methods/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximizing Impact with a Triad of Tailored Copywriting Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-making-a-mark-jujutsu-kaisen-on-the-tiktok-scene/"><u>[New] Making a Mark Jujutsu Kaisen on the TikTok Scene</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-captivating-audience-leading-5-tiktok-font-generators-of-2023-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Captivating Audience Leading 5 TikTok Font Generators of 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-masterclass-streamlining-your-video-uploads-on-tiktok-macwindows/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Masterclass Streamlining Your Video Uploads on TikTok (Mac/Windows)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-skyline-pixel-boost-pro-windowsmac-suite/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Skyline Pixel Boost Pro Windows/Mac Suite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-pro-level-playback-advanced-techniques-for-capturing-minecraft-games-on-mac/"><u>[Updated] Pro-Level Playback Advanced Techniques for Capturing Minecraft Games on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-most-popular-tiktok-items-now-available-on-amazon-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Most Popular TikTok Items Now Available on Amazon for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/for-people-wanting-to-mock-gps-on-oppo-find-x7-ultra-devices-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Oppo Find X7 Ultra Devices | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/resident-evil-village-solutions-when-it-fails-to-open-or-boot-up/"><u>Resident Evil Village: Solutions When It Fails to Open or Boot Up</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/speak-with-style-mastering-the-art-of-altering-vocal-effects-on-snapchat/"><u>Speak with Style Mastering the Art of Altering Vocal Effects on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/44k344on44o844oi44og44o844ot44o844go44k544oi44o844oq44o85yuv55s744ks44gk44gq44gq5yq55p6c55qe44gq5oml5rov/"><u>ショートムービーとストーリー動画をつなぐ効果的な手法</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The users range from influencers, individuals who use it for entertainment, and brands to gain authority and awareness. In 2020, most people spent their days at home, making its popularity explode. Conclusively, the marketing opportunities increased.</p><p>Individuals and brands can promote their businesses using the <strong>TikTok campaign</strong>. The high engagement of the young audience, as mentioned earlier, makes the app outstanding. 90% of the young audience accesses the app several times a day. The high accessibility guarantees broad reach. The breakthrough within the app is very high as compared to other apps. It ensures all videos have easy engagement. Despite you having a small circle, your videos can still go viral. The app’s design with TikTok campaigns helps businesses grow since you can easily access influencers and users within a limited physical location.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What are TikTok Campaigns?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Top 10 TikTok Ads&#x2F; TikTok Brand Campaigns Examples Worth looking</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tips to Run an Excellent TikTok Ad Campaign</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Some FAQs about TikTok Campaigns</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-TikTok-Campaigns"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-TikTok-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are TikTok Campaigns?"></a>Part 1: What are TikTok Campaigns?</h2><p>If you intend on marketing to younger adults, especially women, then TikTok is the best platform. It makes this option be a natural fit. Women make up almost half the total number of users aged between 18 and 24 years in the advertising audience.</p><p>The largest TikTok audience is in the United States, with over 120,768,500 people. The percentage of adults within the app is the most exciting part. All TikTok ads can reach other countries apart from American content. They can reach Asia and the Middle East as well undoubtedly.</p><p>Ads on the TikTok ad campaign offer excellent reach if you intend to work with an international audience.</p><p>The question now is who needs to invest in TikTok advertisement? Brands with a range of audiences may find TikTok is a better platform to test their campaigns.

Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events</strong></p><p>TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website’s header.</p><p>Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.</p><p><strong>2. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them</strong></p><p>Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs.

Create Target Audiences that Aren’t Too Small</strong></p><p>There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That’s a considerable number, though!</p><p>On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.</p><p><strong>4. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind</strong></p><p>You’re interrupting someone’s feed with a brand ad that the user didn’t ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.</p><p><strong>5.

The TikTok ad campaign, with its many forms, allows brands to take an engaging approach that offers higher user engagement.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-master-the-art-of-viral-success-on-tiktok-with-top-7-must-haves/"><u>[New] Master the Art of Viral Success on TikTok with Top 7 Must-Haves</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-tiktoks-hidden-treasures-grab-em-all-for-free/"><u>[New] TikTok's Hidden Treasures Grab 'Em All for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-top-9-accelerators-skyrocketing-your-tiktok-community/"><u>[New] Top 9 Accelerators Skyrocketing Your TikTok Community</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-liberating-your-account-beyond-the-shadowban-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Liberating Your Account Beyond the Shadowban for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-seamlessly-integrate-into-others-tiktok-livestreams-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Seamlessly Integrate Into Others’ TikTok Livestreams for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-apple-iphone-12-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Apple iPhone 12 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/essential-list-premium-free-video-player-apps-pc-and-mobile/"><u>Essential List Premium Free Video Player Apps (PC & Mobile)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/essential-lol-live-stream-setups-3-strategies/"><u>Essential LOL Live Stream Setups - 3 Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-harnessing-power-of-luts-for-advanced-obs-studio-output/"><u>In 2024, Harnessing Power of LUTs for Advanced OBS Studio Output</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-i-screen-mirroring-apple-iphone-se-to-tvlaptop-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Can I Screen Mirroring Apple iPhone SE to TV/Laptop? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/perfecting-windows-drivers-ms-basic-render/"><u>Perfecting Windows Drivers, MS Basic Render</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/the-rhythm-revolution-crafting-mesmerizing-tiktok-dances-with-mac-for-2024/"><u>The Rhythm Revolution Crafting Mesmerizing TikTok Dances with Mac for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ultimate-frames-per-second-for-slow-clips/"><u>Ultimate Frames Per Second for Slow Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/why-is-my-infinix-hot-30i-offline-troubleshooting-guide-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Why Is My Infinix Hot 30i Offline?

These servers cater to Packet Capture, Telco Edge, and Open-RAN applications (to name a few), all of which require high-performance servers that can be easily transported to different locations quickly.</p><p> The two “fly-away-kits” Next Computing has unveiled are the NextServer-X 1U and 2U. As their names suggest, the 1U can hold up to two 1U server chassis, while the 2U can hold a single 2U rack mount chassis. Both products encapsulate their host servers in a rugged TSA-certified travel case with wheels that are easy to wheel around airports and train stations. (Essentially, it is just one giant piece of luggage.) Both cases measure 21.75” x 13.875” x 9.00”.</p><p> Despite their portability, the NextServer-X lineup houses some incredibly potent specifications. The 1U and 2U come with single-socket Ampere Altera processors with options between 32 and 128 cores. Memory is configurable up to 2TB of 3200MHz<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ecc-memory-ram-glossary-definition,6013.html" >ECC RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Power comes from two hot-swappable 600W 80 Plus Platinum PSUs. The second PSU is for redundancy. Networking consists of quadruple 1G copper Intel i210<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gigabit-ethernet-bandwidth,2321-3.html" >Gigabit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jim-keller-suggests-nvidia-should-have-used-ethernet-to-stitch-together-blackwell-gpus" >Ethernet controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but the specs say other networking options are available.</p><p> The 1U and 2U differ in storage and GPU capacity. The 2U can hold GPUs and more storage, but the 1U option can hold two 1U servers.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> The 1U fly-away-kit features two removable 3.5GB&#x2F;s<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvme-2-0-supports-hard-disk-drives" >NVMe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.5” drive bays and no dedicated GPU support. The 2U option expands drive support to eight drives in total, featuring removable mid-plane-based drive bays that house up to eight NVMe 2.5” drives. These (up to) eight drives can be configured to run as JBOD or in RAID 0,1,5 or 6 configurations.</p><p> Optionally, the server can also hold an HBA card to add another eight U.2 NVMe SSDs if needed. The U2 option offers two additional fixed NVMe M.2 4.0 SSDs and up to 2 additional removable SATA 3 SSDs. As for GPUs, the 2U can house Nvidia’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-rtx-a2000-low-profile-workstation-gpu" >RTX A2000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-4000-sff-benchmarked" >RTX 4000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> graphics cards.</p><p> Both of these units will be great for businesses that utilize<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-crams-meteor-lake-laptop-chips-into-a-socket-for-edge-computing-includes-arc-graphics-and-npu-for-ai-workloads" >edge computing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Edge computing is a growing computing strategy that allocates some (or most) of a business’s computing power on-site rather than from a cloud solution alone. It significantly reduces internet bandwidth requirements, saving resources and time. The computing strategy has become incredibly popular over the past few years, especially for AI workloads. Reports confirm that data consumption is growing substantially more than internet services can handle worldwide, forcing businesses to switch to edge-based methods for computing.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-block-youtube-ads-on-chromefirefoxandroidiphone-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Block YouTube Ads on Chrome/Firefox/Android/iPhone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-top-tier-streaming-tech-ranking-5-top-conference-recorder-devices/"><u>[Updated] Top-Tier Streaming Tech Ranking 5 Top Conference Recorder Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-chromes-favorite-video-clippers-from-facebook/"><u>2024 Approved Chromes' Favorite Video Clippers From Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/6-proven-ways-to-unlock-itel-p40plus-phone-when-you-forget-the-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>6 Proven Ways to Unlock Itel P40+ Phone When You Forget the Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/code-vein-crashing-solutions-effective-methods-to-resolve-game-stutter/"><u>Code Vein Crashing Solutions: Effective Methods to Resolve Game Stutter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/comprehensive-hardware-guides-by-tomtechinsight/"><u>Comprehensive Hardware Guides by TomTechInsight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-oppo-find-n3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, 10 Fake GPS Location Apps on Android Of your Oppo Find N3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-nailing-your-online-visibility-with-optimal-youtube-thumbnail-dimensions/"><u>In 2024, Nailing Your Online Visibility with Optimal YouTube Thumbnail Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplified-process-for-name-change-in-google-meet-laptopmobile/"><u>In 2024, Simplified Process for Name Change in Google Meet (Laptop/Mobile)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/latest-firmware-how-to-perform-an-update-on-samsung-smart-tvs/"><u>Latest Firmware: How to Perform an Update on Samsung Smart TVs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/mastering-quick-drivers-updating-for-winos-10-to-7/"><u>Mastering Quick Drivers Updating for WINOS 10 to 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/toms-hardware-review-top-tech-insights-and-guides/"><u>Tom's Hardware Review: Top Tech Insights and Guides</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/unbeatable-price-on-alienware-aurora-r16-latest-tech-with-rtx-4080-and-i9-chip-plus-half-off-savings/"><u>Unbeatable Price on Alienware Aurora R16 - Latest Tech with RTX 4080 & I9 Chip Plus Half Off Savings</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1828647/21290" target="_top" id="1828647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1828647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1828647/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Featuring an anti-screenshot notification system that automatically notifies posters when a recipient or audience member screenshots a snap, it’s become increasingly harder to screenshot without being detected.</p><p>That being said, there are still plenty of other methods that offer a practical alternative to ensure you avoid that awkward automated notification.</p><h4 id="Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot"><a href="#Option-1-Use-Another-Phone-or-Mobile-Device-to-Take-Snapchat-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot"></a>Option 1. Use Another Phone or Mobile Device to Take Snapchat Screenshot</h4><p>An easy and risk-free way to capture and store a specific snap with ease, utilizing another mobile device or camera is a great method that requires very little effort. Simply us a second phone, or a nearby tablet, to record the whole duration of the video or photo.</p><p>Although the quality of the recording won’t be as crisp and clear as it appears on the handheld, this is a reliable and fool-proof way to preserve those special snaps. From those video recordings, you should then be able to crop out the video or image you needed.</p><p>Missed it?</p><p>Why not take advantage of Snapchat’s “replay” mode to ensure you get the perfect shot – but be warned, posters also get notified of this too.</p><h4 id="Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11"><a href="#Option-2-Use-the-Built-In-Screen-Recoding-Tool-on-iOS11" class="headerlink" title="Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11"></a>Option 2. Use the Built-In Screen Recoding Tool on iOS11</h4><p>If you didn’t already know, there’s a built-in screen recording software within iOS11 that allows you to effectively capture and record snaps with ease. Lying within the Settings of any iPhone, follow these easy steps on how to live record your screen:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Head to Settings &gt; Control Centre &gt; Customize Controls</li><li>Step 2: Locate the “Screen Recording” functionality</li><li>Step 3: Select the small cross to add it to your Control Centre</li><li>Step 4: To activate – Tap the icon with the 2 concentric circles to start recording. To complete a recording, simply tap the red bar that’s present at the top of the screen and select “End Recording”.</li></ul><p>Although it’s not possible to start recording a snap whilst it’s already open, it’s best to start recording before you opt to open a specific message.</p><p>Please note: If you have updated to Snapchat version 10.17.5, the posters will be notified each and every time you initiate and capture a recording through the use of this built-in recorder.</p><h4 id="Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac"><a href="#Option-3-Use-QuickTime-Screen-Capture-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac"></a>Option 3. Use QuickTime Screen Capture on a Mac</h4><p>A little more technical than simply using another mobile device to record a snap, using the QuickTime Player is an efficient and high-quality method for those looking to secretly store a snapchat post.</p><p>To start recording snaps, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac</li><li>Step 2: Open the QuickTime Player application</li><li>Step 3: Select <strong>File &gt; New Movie Recording</strong> from the menu</li><li>Step 4: Once loaded, simply hover the mouse beside the recording button. By clicking the small arrow, you’ll be provided with a range of different recording options</li><li>Step 5: Select your Phone as the <strong>Movie Recording Input</strong></li></ul><p>Once connected, your Mac screen should now be mirroring your mobile device. Just like you would on your phone, simply hit record and head on over to the Snapchat application to begin recording.</p><h4 id="Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android"><a href="#Option-4-Use-the-Mirror-Feature-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android"></a>Option 4. Use the Mirror Feature for Android</h4><p>Similar to the use of QuickTime or the iOS11 Screen Recording software, Screen Mirroring is another effective method for capturing Snapchat screenshots without the poster being made aware. By connecting a HDMI cable to both your TV and laptop, or by accessing the “Screen Mirroring” application that’s often built-in to most Smart Phones and Android devices, it’s possible to mirror&#x2F;cast the active screen on your device onto an external platform.</p><p>In doing so, you’re presented with the opportunity to utilize another device to record a playing snap or even share a recently received snap with other audience members that are present in the room.</p><h4 id="Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification"><a href="#Option-5-Delay-the-Snapchat-Screenshot-Notification" class="headerlink" title="Option 5.

Delay the Snapchat Screenshot Notification</h4><p>A method for those feeling a more confident or even for those that aren’t too bothered about their posters receiving a notification in the long run, this method is a great way to delay the arrival of that pop-down notification.</p><p>To delay the notification process, follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Load the Snapchat application on your mobile device</li><li>Step 2: Find the snap you want to open&#x2F;record (ensure it is fully loaded)</li><li>Step 3: Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data</li><li>Step 4: Turn on the Airplane Mode</li><li>Step 5: Open the snap and take your screenshot</li><li>Step 6: Wait approximately 30 seconds and then turn all your connections back on</li></ul><p>Designed to postpone the process of the poster receiving a notification, but not allowing for viewers to screenshot undetected, this method allows audience members to screenshot snaps from those that are perhaps a little unobservant when it comes to checking their notifications.</p><p>Be warned though, some posters may catch on to this method of screenshotting and they may stop sharing their videos and images with you.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Despite there being plenty of reasons why there might be a need for you to record a Snapchat memory without the sender being made aware, it’s important to note that this can also be viewed as a breach of privacy with senders not only being informed of who has taken a screenshot, but also how many times they’ve done so and of which post.</p><p>With Snapchat designed to maintain the notion that any media sent between users is considered temporary, thanks to the 5-10 second duration limit, the methods listed above, although not fail-proof, are suggested as simple yet effective ways to avoid triggering an unwanted notification whilst using this highly popular social networking application.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-blue-scrn-win.png"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-blue-scrn-mac.png"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-mastering-nighttime-shots-iphone-photo-tactics-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Nighttime Shots IPhone Photo Tactics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-top-15-best-cameras-for-vlogging/"><u>[New] Top 15 Best Cameras for Vlogging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-unrivaled-unity-30plus-creative-biography-approaches-for-increasing-views-and-followers-with-filmora/"><u>[New] Unrivaled Unity 30+ Creative Biography Approaches for Increasing Views and Followers with Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-earning-success-on-tiktok-unraveling-the-top-8-pathways/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Earning Success on TikTok Unraveling the Top 8 Pathways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-innovate-your-tiktok-intro-video-a-mac-perspective/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How to Innovate Your TikTok Intro Video -

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner. Its body composition tool is a particular highlight.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 looks and feels lovely to use. Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome.

The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

As we previously reported, the brand’s sales increased so dramatically in the prior year that CNN Business covered it.

A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.</p><p>Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, <strong>text to speech on TikTok</strong> lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.</p><p>TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.</p><p>Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.</p><p>Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?"></a>Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</h2><p>In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version"><a href="#Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version"></a>Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version</h4><p>First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="latest version tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording a Video"></a>Step 2: Start Recording a Video</h4><p>Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘<strong>Done</strong>’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png"                      alt="enter text tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech"></a>Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech</h4><p>When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png"                      alt="tap-text-to speech tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally"><a href="#Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Save the Video Locally"></a>Step 5: Save the Video Locally</h4><p>It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “<strong>Save to Device</strong>” option is active and you can post it privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="save-to device tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers"><a href="#Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers"></a>Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers</h4><p>Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave"><a href="#Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave"></a>Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave</h4><p>Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok"><a href="#Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok"></a>Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok</h4><p>Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits. You will get a TikTok video with a customized text-to-speech voice for all intents and purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="upload video tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Customize-the-Text-To-Speech-Voice-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Customize-the-Text-To-Speech-Voice-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the powerful and easy-to-use video editing software that lets content creators empower the story and be amazed at results, no matter the skill level.

For your reference, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-zen-3-ryzen-5000-release-date-specifications-pricing-benchmarks-all-we-know" >Zen 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> architecture was released in late 2020, and we’re currently awaiting the release of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-shares-new-cpu-core-roadmap-3nm-zen-5-by-2024-4th-gen-infinity-architecture" >Zen 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here in 2024.</p><p> So, for the most part, the Ayaneo AM01 is still pretty much the same classic Macintosh-inspired mini-PC we covered before and has a very similar pricing scheme with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800u-cezanne-zen-3-apu-geekbench-benchmark" >Ryzen 7 5800U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it does with other units. As-is, the Zen 3 Ryzen 7 5800U model looks astonishingly identical to the Zen 2 Ryzen 7 5700U at a glance, with the same basic core&#x2F;thread spec, though, of course, the newer architecture has much better performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zkexFiVS4JdrAYoKakvYu5-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Current pricing matrix for the Zen 3-based Ryzen 7 5800U configuration of Ayaneo AM01."                ></p><p> Current pricing matrix for the Zen 3-based Ryzen 7 5800U configuration of Ayaneo AM01.  (Image credit: Ayaneo)</p><p> The Ayaneo blog post also confirms that the Ryzen 7 is slated to operate at up to 35 Watts on the AM01, an ample boost to the official maximum TDP of 25 Watts. This higher TDP enabled alongside the proper<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ram,4057.html" >RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> selection should help maximize the performance of the iGPU within.</p><p> Pricing-wise, the Ayaneo AM01 is best purchased during the Early Bird window, which is a solid $30 cheaper. Considering the specs and size of the device, the price point is pretty tolerable for what it is, though the best bang for your buck will be found in devices like the LCD<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/steam-deck-valve-gaming-handheld" >Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , used PCs, etc.</p><p> If you hope to get your hands on the Ayaneo AM01 PC as soon as possible, head to their Indiegogo page to buy the device through crowdfunding. And as always, while we acknowledge Ayaneo’s excellent track record in crowdfunded devices, you can’t know what to expect until people get their hands on it.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp;

The new<a class="link"   href="https://www.minisforum.com/page/x7ti/index.html?lang=en" >AtomMan X7 Ti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> becomes the first in the firm’s AtomMan line, described as a high-end cutting-edge marque by Minisforum. It is also claimed to be the “first Intel Ultra 9 AI Mini PC with a 4-inch Touchscreen.” With the rising popularity of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/hands-on-lian-lis-lcd-screen-fans-turn-heads-and-are-surprisingly-affordable-but-not-as-configurable-as-id-like" >extra screens in PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , integrating one into a compact desktop might be a popular idea.</p><p> Starting from the outside, we see that the AtomMan X7 Ti would be a conventional-looking<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-gets-license-to-make-intel-nucs" >NUC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -alike apart from two things. Firstly, it features a 4-inch 480p touch display which covers a fair portion of the top panel. Secondly, it comes with a neat stand that angles the display panel into an easy glanceable view. Furthermore, Minisforum has followed some logic by situating a 1080p<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-fido2-certification-may-update-microsoft,39261.html" >Windows Hello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compatible webcam and dual mics above the touchscreen, appealing to video conferencing fans.</p><p> While we are considering external features, let’s look at the ports. Despite its compact size (145 x 145 x 49mm), the AtomMan X7 Ti features a decent quantity and selection of ports, as follows: RJ45 5G Ethernet Port ×2, DP 2.0, HDMI 2.1,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/worlds-first-oculink-usb-4-egpu-with-radeor-rx-7600m-xt" >OCulink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Port (up to 64Gbps), USB4 ×2, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A ×2, USB3.2 Gen1 Type-A, USB2.0, a 3.5mm Combo Jack, SD Card slot, and a Power Button with an embedded fingerprint reader. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-7-faq" >Wi-Fi 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bluetooth 5.4 complement the dual Ethernet ports. It must also be noted that the mix of dedicated monitor and USB4 ports means you can connect up to four external displays to this machine.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> Moving inside, the star of the show is the new Intel Core Ultra 9 processor<a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236849/intel-core-ultra-9-processor-185h-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html" >185H <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a 16C&#x2F;22T CPU running at up to 5.1 GHz, and onboard Arc GPU with eight Xe cores running at up to 2.35 GHz.

It uses standard DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs, up to a max of 64GB. There are also two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots, and the aforementioned wireless functionality comes courtesy of a socketed Intel BE200 card, so it can be changed for repair or upgrade.</p><p> We don’t have pricing for the AtomMan X7 Ti. Minisforum says it will go on pre-sale from May 20, so we expect to hear more about pricing and shipping RAM&#x2F;storage configurations at that time. Those particularly interested in this product can sign up for an email about it and get a $30 coupon from Minisforum.</p><p> We caught a first glimpse of the AtomMan X7 Ti<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-first-intel-core-ultra-mini-pc-amd-rx-7600M-xt-mini-pc" >at CES 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it was showcased with other interesting new computers like the Minisforum HX200G, Mini Workstation MS-01, and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tablets/minisforum-v3-tablet-arrives-the-worlds-first-amd-ryzen-7-8840u-powered-surface-clone" >V3 tablet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-camstreamers-analysis-seeking-superior-solutions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved CamStreamers Analysis Seeking Superior Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-maximizing-potential-key-know-how-for-technological-progress/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Maximizing Potential Key Know-How for Technological Progress</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-inspirational-highlights-the-top-15-tiktok-stars-for-2024/"><u>[New] Inspirational Highlights The Top 15 TikTok Stars for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-captivating-crowds-essential-biographical-elements-boosting-follower-count-on-tiktok-filmora/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Captivating Crowds Essential Biographical Elements Boosting Follower Count on TikTok-Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-art-of-tiktok-dance-a-step-by-step-guide-for-mac-users/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Art of TikTok Dance A Step-by-Step Guide for Mac Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionize-your-tiktok-videos-the-ultimate-filter-list-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionize Your TikTok Videos The Ultimate Filter List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/boosting-your-competitive-edge-with-custom-vocalization-techniques-in-free-fire-gaming-free-solution-included/"><u>Boosting Your Competitive Edge with Custom Vocalization Techniques in Free Fire Gaming (Free Solution Included)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-samsung-galaxy-f34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Here are Some Pro Tips for Pokemon Go PvP Battles On Samsung Galaxy F34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-realme-gt-3-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Realme GT 3 Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-leave-a-life360-group-on-xiaomi-13-ultra-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Leave a Life360 Group On Xiaomi 13 Ultra Without Anyone Knowing?

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

You won’t get the fastest GPU around, but you will be able to play games at 1080p with modest settings. That’s a big improvement over relying on integrated graphics.  </p><p> For the graphics card in this system, we’re going with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-arc-a380-review" >Intel’s Arc A380 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We didn’t love the card at launch, but it’s readily available at<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for $119 and has been for a long time. Besides that, it’s faster than AMD’s competing RX 6400, comes with more VRAM, and most importantly it has full video encoding&#x2F;decoding acceleration — including AV1 support for the future.  </p><p> The card averaged 54.7 fps in our benchmarks at 1080p medium, though updated drivers may have improved things another 5–10 percent. If you want something a little faster and can expand your budget by just a few dollars, your best bet is this<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%252AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=tomshardware-us-4229400190691839476&murl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fpowercolor-radeon-rx-6500-xt-axrx-6500xt-4gbd6-dh-oc%252Fp%252FN82E16814131792" >RX 6500 XT card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which goes for<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%252AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=tomshardware-us-3432138791918776745&murl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fasrock-radeon-rx-6500-xt-rx6500xt-pgd-4go%252Fp%252FN82E16814930067" >around $139 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and can take you up to 65.8 fps in 1080p medium.  </p><p> For our CPU, we’re going with Intel’s Core i3-14100F which is just over $100 but delivers plenty of pep for the price. This CPU has four cores, all of them performance cores, and a solid boost clock of 4.7 GHz. It comes with a cooler in the box so there’s no need for a third-party one. We found that the 13100F was about on par with AMD’s Ryzen 5 5600, which costs about $30 more.  </p><p> To work with our 14100F, we need an Intel 700-series motherboard. Finding the right balance of features and pricing is critical, and you need to be careful that you pick a board that uses the correct type of memory. DDR5 boards can sometimes be $10 cheaper but then the memory can cost $20 more. The best overall value right now is the<a class="link"   href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR_URL=https://amazon.com/dp/B0BSB6MB15?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=tomshardware-us-1262085555323577715-20" >Gigabyte B760M DS3H DDR4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a microATX board that uses DDR4 RAM and comes with two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots for SSDs, plus four memory slots, offering decent options for future upgrades.  </p><p> At this price, the motherboard has one big trade-off, which is that you don’t get built-in Wi-Fi. So, if you need wireless, you’ll need to buy your own USB or PCIe Wi-Fi dongle, which usually costs between $25 and $40. You may already have one or maybe you’ll be using Ethernet. Alternatively, you could look for a similar board that includes Wi-Fi, but the least expensive DDR4 board we could find is this<a class="link"   href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR_URL=https://amazon.com/dp/B0BRQSWSFQ?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=tomshardware-us-9394941530667512067-20" >MSI Pro B760-P WiFi for $149 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — a $50 bump for that one feature.  </p><p> We chose the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/silicon-power-ud90-ssd-review" >Silicon Power UD90 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as a very affordable PCIe 4.0 SSD that delivers up to 5,000 MB&#x2F;s for sequential reads and 4,800 MB&#x2F;s for sequential writes. The UD90 uses TLC NAND, which means performance won’t collapse as the drive fills up — a common concern with SSDs that uses cheaper QLC NAND. When we tested the 1TB model a couple of years back, we declared it the new value champion for SSDs. There are cheaper drives, but nothing can match the overall performance without increasing the price. It doesn’t have a DRAM cache, so if you want that feature you’ll need to buy a more expensive drive (see the builds below for other options).  </p><p> We selected 16GB of DDR4 PC-3200 RAM in a 2x8GB configuration for our memory. Again, choosing RAM that works with your motherboard is critical. The Silicon Power Value RAM we chose isn’t the flashiest, but it’s inexpensive and memory has become a commodity item. Whatever you do, don’t build or buy a<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/dont-buy-pc-with-8gb-of-ram" >gaming PC with less than 16GB of RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .  </p><p> Our case is the Cooler Master MasterBox Q300L. Available in black or white, the chassis has solid build quality for the price, including built-in dust filters, support for up to a 240mm AIO cooler on the top, and plenty of mesh to allow airflow in. It even has a modular I&#x2F;O panel you can place in six different locations. One small trade-off is that its clear side panel is acrylic rather than tempered glass.  </p><p> Finally, we need something to power the whole system, and this is an area where we opted to compromise in pursuit of the $500 price point. The $40 500W PSU should be fine for this basic build, which will likely peak at around 200W of power use, but the Thermaltake Smart series isn’t exactly highly regarded, and the listing mentions Haswell support (circa 2014) and it only has 80 Plus certification, which are clear drawbacks. If you want a quality PSU, check out the<a class="link"   href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR_URL=https://amazon.com/dp/B087CDR14Z?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=tomshardware-us-2901418645577992029-20" >Thermaltake Toughpower GX2 600W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that costs $20 more.

Here we’re stepping up from a Core i3 to the Core i5-14400F, which has 6 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores and 16 total threads, along with a boost clock of 4.7 GHz.</p><p> To be fair, the 14400F is not the fastest gaming CPU in its price range as that honor belongs to AMD’s Ryzen 7 5700X3D and its generous V-Cache. However, AMD’s chip requires a slightly-more-expensive motherboard and needs a third-party cooler while Intel’s chip comes with a stock air cooler in the box. As you can see in the chart below, the 14400F (listed as the 14400, but the F model is just the SKU without integrated graphics), was behind some competitors but still turned in solid performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FVyBrR3Fkm8RXeguWat4ik-320-80.png"                      alt="14400 CPU vs competition"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> To go with this Intel processor, we’re using an ASRock B760M-HDV motherboard because it supports 14th Gen CPUs without a BIOS update.

stretch your budget up to around $1,000, you can build a PC with the ability to play games really well at 1080p and competently at 1440p. The best GPU option in this price range right now is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-review" >Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which goes for as little as $374. While the Radeon RX 6750 XT, which has 12GB of VRAM to the 4060 Ti’s 8GB, is in the same price range, Nvidia’s GPU is much better for ray tracing.  </p><p> In our 8-game rasterization test suite at 1080p ultra settings, the RTX 4060 Ti offered an impressive frame rate of 101.7 fps while delivering a still-strong 75.5 fps at 1440p with ultra settings. At this price point, don’t expect to do much ray tracing, however. The card managed a very-playable 52.8 fps at 1080p and a usable 33.5 fps at 1440p.</p><p> Our recommended CPU for this build is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review" >AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html" >best gaming CPUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can get, particularly for the price. This 8-core, 16-thread CPU has 96MB of L3 cache, which makes it great for 1080p gaming. On our tests, it edged out more-expensive competitors like the Ryzen 5 7600X and the Core i5-14400.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FubLpBjdNUCy6aXRouBReZ-320-80.jpg"                      alt="CPU 1080p performance for Ryzen 7 5700X3D"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Newegg)</p><p> To support our Ryzen 7 57003XD, we’re using a Gigabyte B550 UD AC motherboard.

This may be necessary as the 5700X3D just came out a few months ago.</p><p> The Ryzen 7 5700X3D doesn’t come with a stock cooler so we’re adding an inexpensive, 240mm AIO cooler to the mix.</p><p> We’re sticking with 32GB of DDR4-PC3200 RAM here. There’s no real need to go faster or increase the capacity at this price point. Using DDR4 saves us money over DDR5.</p><p> For storage, we’re stepping up to a faster, higher-capacity SSD: the 2TB version of WD Black SN580. This PCIe 4.0 drive promises sequential read and write speeds of 4,150 MBps, along with random read &#x2F; write IOPS of 600K and 750K respectively. It’s not the fastest drive on the market, but it gets the job done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YduTXHRsvK8iHR2sEsSWHH-320-80.png"                      alt="3DMark Storage for WD SN580"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> We’re going with the<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%252AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=tomshardware-us-3971734713525887260&murl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fblack-phanteks-xt-mid-tower%252Fp%252F11-854-132" >Phanteks XT Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as our case, because it has a quality, mesh design, room for up to a 360mm AIO up top and the ability to support back-connecting motherboards, should you get one in the future.

We recommend going with an RTX 4070 at this price point.</p><p> At press time, RTX 4070 cards selling for as little as $5. In our<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html" >GPU benchmarks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hierarchy, the 4070 beats the RTX 3080 (10GB) and comes in just a step behind the 3080 (12GB) at non-ray tracing 1080p gaming. On our suite of 8 games, at 1080p ultra settings, the 4070 managed 123.6 fps. At 1440p resolution, it offered a smooth 98.6 fps and, even at 4K, it provided a very-playable 67.2 fps.</p><p> With ray tracing enabled, the RTX 4070 delivers 69.4 fps at 1080 ultra and a playable 45.2 fps at 1440p. In some titles, the numbers are much higher. For example, in Spider-Man: Miles Morales at 1440p, the card returned an average frame rate of 69 fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgVebfNva528szwrGpaooB-320-80.png"                      alt="RTX 4070 Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ray Tracing results"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> We’re also upgrading the CPU to<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review" >Intel’s Core i5-14600KF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an overclockable processor that has 6 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores, 20 threads and a boost clock of 5.3 GHz. That’s before you attempt to overclock it.</p><p> We’re going with the Gigabyte Z790 Gaming X AX motherboard, which allows overclocking with a 16+2+1 phases digital VRM design.

In ray tracing, the gap widens a lot more, with the 4090 averaging 58 fps, the 4080 sits at 41 fps, and the fastest card from AMD, the 7900 XTX, gets just 30 fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKv5emaUBYKBRQ8URPsxCY-320-80.png"                      alt="RTX 4090 Performance"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> Our CPU is AMD’s Ryzen 9 7950X3D, which offers faster gaming than any Intel CPU on the market, including the Core i9-14900K.

However, it also has a tempered glass side panel which you can use to show off all of your RGB components (or you can buy it with a solid panel and no window). It also has fantastic thermal performance and plenty of room for more drives and fans.

Also, remember that these tools are not in any way associated with Tik Tok officially. Instead, they act as supportive platforms for calculation.</p><h4 id="1-Tik-Tok-Influencer-Earnings-Calculator"><a href="#1-Tik-Tok-Influencer-Earnings-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, their project of biddable ads is in progress. It will be launched soon after completion. What brands search for are different influencers either according to the niche or growth of a particular Tik Tok account. Nowadays, influencers have to contact brands for promotions or stuff like that. So, if you have more count on followers and engagement as an influencer, you would be going to get the right amount on those sponsorships.</p><p>The most important aspect is to calculate the engagement rate. It is because it’s a highly considerable factor brand may look. However, there is no official method to calculate the engagement rate. Most of the published ones are inaccurate. They won’t tell you the correct specs about the percentage of people opening the app once a day. For accuracy concerns, we’ve devised a formula to calculate individual Tik Tok account engagement. The formula states as [No. of hearts + No. of comments]&#x2F; No. of followers] × 100.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Calculates engagement rate</li><li>DIY method</li><li>Zero cost solution</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Not super effective</li></ul><h4 id="2-Igface"><a href="#2-Igface" class="headerlink" title="2.

Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee"><a href="#Likee" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world. It is a social platform for sharing short videos. As with Likee, it is the perfect tool for creating the most amazing multimedia content that you can think of.</p><p>Both these apps are used for creating and sharing short videos on social media and are compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. Each of these apps offers a range of attractions for their young users.</p><p>With people debating on whether to stick with TikTok or switch to Likee, are you confused about what sets apart these video-sharing apps from each other? Here’s a detailed comparison of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Likee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headquarters</td><td>China</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Type</td><td>TikTok is a PGC (Profession Generated Content) platform</td><td>Likee is a UGC (User Generated Content) platform</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Options</td><td>A multitude of video effects Emojis, text, frames, trimming videos, and much more</td><td>AI &amp; AR-based technology Realistic hair color filters, 4D magic, superpower effects</td></tr><tr><td>Music Options</td><td>Broad and up-to-date music catalog. Third-party apps are needed to add their own music</td><td>The built-in music library is fairly limited to TikTok. Allows users to add ‘local music’</td></tr><tr><td>Text Options</td><td>Text boxes with accurate timing and positioning. The background color is adjustable</td><td>Multiple text boxes with accurate timing. Ability to change the size, font, color, angle, and background</td></tr><tr><td>Socialization</td><td>TikTok aims to redefine digital socialization by introducing online video socialization</td><td>Likee allows user to watch live streaming and make new friends by People Nearby function</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users worldwide</td><td>150 million monthly active users</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok"><a href="#Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Will Likee Surpass TikTok?"></a>Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</h2><p>With the whole “TikTok being banned in the US” becoming a thing, some assumed that competitors will soon surpass TikTok. However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed. But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos. What makes TikTok so addictive is that the app enables users to express themselves through different creative ways.</p><h4 id="2-Native-Content-Editor"><a href="#2-Native-Content-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2.Native Content Editor"></a>2.Native Content Editor</h4><p>TikTok’s features to shoot footage, quickly trim and stitch together video clips and incorporate voice as well as music effects at the touch of a button makes it the ideal destination for every creator. When it comes to Likee vs. TikTok, what makes the trim feature of TikTok so enticing is that the app allows creators to storyboard their videos and publish their finished product.</p><h4 id="3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos"><a href="#3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos"></a>3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos</h4><p>The homepage of TikTok is much more like Twitter than Instagram or Facebook. This means that viral videos with great engagement move to the front of the line and comprise the feed. Although a “Discover” tab allows you to browse specific topics and hashtags, you are served with one video at a time.</p><p>This is a part of TikTok’s competitive advantage over Likee. With an endless number of prompts, it is easy to participate since you need not have anything interesting to talk about to get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-problem.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok Problem"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.theguardian.com/" >www.theguardian.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902304/19272" target="_top" id="1902304">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902304" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902304/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>No matter whether you are social media lurker or a content creator, be assured that TikTok is here to stay. Don’t believe us? Try Likee for yourself and you will soon realize that TikTok is unmatchable.
