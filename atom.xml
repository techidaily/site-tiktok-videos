Download Video Star App"></a>1. Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star" class="headerlink" title="3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star"></a>3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star</h4><p>Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time. The Video Star app lets you create as many clones of yourself as you want, so you just have to make sure that your video clips can be easily combined to feature two or more of your clones and have fun exploring the effects that can make your videos look even cooler. If you want to be a success on the TikTok platform, learning how to make clone videos is one of the best ways to do it, so choose your favorite songs and start producing clone yourself videos.</p><p>You can also use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make a split-screen with ease.

Download Video Star App"></a>1. Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips-1"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star-1"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star"></a>3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star</h4><p>Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time.

When you build a gaming PC, you get total control of the parts, choosing the exact make and model of motherboard, a case with the look you like and even the layout of RGB (or non-RGB fans). You could save time by purchasing one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-gaming-pcs" >best pre-built gaming PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but you’ll give up control and spend more.</p><p> By constructing your own PC from components, you will likely save hundreds of dollars over the cost of buying a prebuilt system. For example, right now, getting a desktop with specs similar to those in our best $1,000 PC build will cost you<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://shop-links.co/link?skuId=6553248&publisher%255Fslug=future&exclusive=1&u1=tomshardware-us-1203878354640289519&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fcyberpowerpc-gamer-master-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-7-7700-32gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-2tb-ssd-white%252F6553248.p%253FskuId%253D6553248&article%255Fname=Best%2520PC%2520Builds%2520for%2520Gaming%25202024%253A%2520From%2520%2524500%2520Budgets%2520to%2520%25244%252C000%252B%2520%257C%2520Tom%27s%2520Hardware&article%255Furl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.tomshardware.com%252Fbest-picks%252Fbest-pc-builds-gaming" >$1,439 or more at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> To help you assemble the best PC build for gaming or productivity that you can get, we’ve created recommended parts lists for every budget: from a super-cheap sub-$500 system to an affordable sub-$1,000 build to a $4,000+ dream machine for those with deep pockets.</p><h2 id="Picking-and-Pricing-the-Best-PC-Builds"><a href="#Picking-and-Pricing-the-Best-PC-Builds" class="headerlink" title="Picking and Pricing the Best PC Builds"></a>Picking and Pricing the Best PC Builds</h2><p> Why you can trust Tom’s Hardware  Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-we-test" >Find out more about how we test <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Note that our best PC build recommendations are based on our component expertise, market research and testing we’ve done of the key components in each build, namely the CPU, GPU and SSD. However, because we are trying to hit price points and frequently changing these lists (as prices change), we have not tested all of the parts in each build together and some of the less performance-centric parts such as the case, motherboard and PSU may be ones that we have not reviewed.</p><p> We are also going to recommend GPUs rather than specific makes and models of graphics cards. For example, we’d recommend an RTX 4070 Ti and link to a list of available cards rather than, for example, the<a class="link"   href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR_URL=https://amazon.com/ZOTAC-Graphics-IceStorm-Advanced-ZT-D40710J-10P/dp/B0BQCVTSR3?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=tomshardware-us-1261595583226646282-20" >Zotac RTX 4070 Ti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR_URL=https://amazon.com/ZOTAC-Graphics-IceStorm-Advanced-ZT-D40810B-10P/dp/B0BKK3RFT6/?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=tomshardware-us-8032896364299685703-20" >. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Given frequent price and stock changes in the space, you should get whichever third or first-party card is available with the GPU you want for the best price at the time you read this.</p><p> Also note that we don’t include the cost of an operating system, because you can get<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/get-windows-10-free-or-cheap,5717.html" >Windows for Free or Cheap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

You won’t get the fastest GPU around, but you will be able to play games at 1080p with modest settings. That’s a big improvement over relying on integrated graphics.  </p><p> For the graphics card in this system, we’re going with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-arc-a380-review" >Intel’s Arc A380 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We didn’t love the card at launch, but it’s readily available at<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for $119 and has been for a long time. Besides that, it’s faster than AMD’s competing RX 6400, comes with more VRAM, and most importantly it has full video encoding&#x2F;decoding acceleration — including AV1 support for the future.  </p><p> The card averaged 54.7 fps in our benchmarks at 1080p medium, though updated drivers may have improved things another 5–10 percent. If you want something a little faster and can expand your budget by just a few dollars, your best bet is this<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%252AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=tomshardware-us-4229400190691839476&murl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fpowercolor-radeon-rx-6500-xt-axrx-6500xt-4gbd6-dh-oc%252Fp%252FN82E16814131792" >RX 6500 XT card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which goes for<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%252AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=tomshardware-us-3432138791918776745&murl=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fasrock-radeon-rx-6500-xt-rx6500xt-pgd-4go%252Fp%252FN82E16814930067" >around $139 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and can take you up to 65.8 fps in 1080p medium.  </p><p> For our CPU, we’re going with Intel’s Core i3-14100F which is just over $100 but delivers plenty of pep for the price. This CPU has four cores, all of them performance cores, and a solid boost clock of 4.7 GHz. It comes with a cooler in the box so there’s no need for a third-party one. We found that the 13100F was about on par with AMD’s Ryzen 5 5600, which costs about $30 more.  </p><p> To work with our 14100F, we need an Intel 700-series motherboard. Finding the right balance of features and pricing is critical, and you need to be careful that you pick a board that uses the correct type of memory. DDR5 boards can sometimes be $10 cheaper but then the memory can cost $20 more. The best overall value right now is the<a class="link"   href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR_URL=https://amazon.com/dp/B0BSB6MB15?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=tomshardware-us-1262085555323577715-20" >Gigabyte B760M DS3H DDR4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a microATX board that uses DDR4 RAM and comes with two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots for SSDs, plus four memory slots, offering decent options for future upgrades.  </p><p> At this price, the motherboard has one big trade-off, which is that you don’t get built-in Wi-Fi. So, if you need wireless, you’ll need to buy your own USB or PCIe Wi-Fi dongle, which usually costs between $25 and $40. You may already have one or maybe you’ll be using Ethernet. Alternatively, you could look for a similar board that includes Wi-Fi, but the least expensive DDR4 board we could find is this<a class="link"   href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR_URL=https://amazon.com/dp/B0BRQSWSFQ?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=tomshardware-us-9394941530667512067-20" >MSI Pro B760-P WiFi for $149 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — a $50 bump for that one feature.  </p><p> We chose the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/silicon-power-ud90-ssd-review" >Silicon Power UD90 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as a very affordable PCIe 4.0 SSD that delivers up to 5,000 MB&#x2F;s for sequential reads and 4,800 MB&#x2F;s for sequential writes. The UD90 uses TLC NAND, which means performance won’t collapse as the drive fills up — a common concern with SSDs that uses cheaper QLC NAND. When we tested the 1TB model a couple of years back, we declared it the new value champion for SSDs. There are cheaper drives, but nothing can match the overall performance without increasing the price. It doesn’t have a DRAM cache, so if you want that feature you’ll need to buy a more expensive drive (see the builds below for other options).  </p><p> We selected 16GB of DDR4 PC-3200 RAM in a 2x8GB configuration for our memory. Again, choosing RAM that works with your motherboard is critical. The Silicon Power Value RAM we chose isn’t the flashiest, but it’s inexpensive and memory has become a commodity item. Whatever you do, don’t build or buy a<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/dont-buy-pc-with-8gb-of-ram" >gaming PC with less than 16GB of RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .  </p><p> Our case is the Cooler Master MasterBox Q300L. Available in black or white, the chassis has solid build quality for the price, including built-in dust filters, support for up to a 240mm AIO cooler on the top, and plenty of mesh to allow airflow in. It even has a modular I&#x2F;O panel you can place in six different locations. One small trade-off is that its clear side panel is acrylic rather than tempered glass.  </p><p> Finally, we need something to power the whole system, and this is an area where we opted to compromise in pursuit of the $500 price point. The $40 500W PSU should be fine for this basic build, which will likely peak at around 200W of power use, but the Thermaltake Smart series isn’t exactly highly regarded, and the listing mentions Haswell support (circa 2014) and it only has 80 Plus certification, which are clear drawbacks. If you want a quality PSU, check out the<a class="link"   href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR_URL=https://amazon.com/dp/B087CDR14Z?tag=hawk-future-20&ascsubtag=tomshardware-us-2901418645577992029-20" >Thermaltake Toughpower GX2 600W <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that costs $20 more.

Here we’re stepping up from a Core i3 to the Core i5-14400F, which has 6 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores and 16 total threads, along with a boost clock of 4.7 GHz.</p><p> To be fair, the 14400F is not the fastest gaming CPU in its price range as that honor belongs to AMD’s Ryzen 7 5700X3D and its generous V-Cache. However, AMD’s chip requires a slightly-more-expensive motherboard and needs a third-party cooler while Intel’s chip comes with a stock air cooler in the box.

There’s no real need to go faster or increase the capacity at this price point. Using DDR4 saves us money over DDR5.</p><p> For storage, we’re stepping up to a faster, higher-capacity SSD: the 2TB version of WD Black SN580. This PCIe 4.0 drive promises sequential read and write speeds of 4,150 MBps, along with random read &#x2F; write IOPS of 600K and 750K respectively.

On our suite of 8 games, at 1080p ultra settings, the 4070 managed 123.6 fps. At 1440p resolution, it offered a smooth 98.6 fps and, even at 4K, it provided a very-playable 67.2 fps.</p><p> With ray tracing enabled, the RTX 4070 delivers 69.4 fps at 1080 ultra and a playable 45.2 fps at 1440p. In some titles, the numbers are much higher. For example, in Spider-Man: Miles Morales at 1440p, the card returned an average frame rate of 69 fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgVebfNva528szwrGpaooB-320-80.png"                      alt="RTX 4070 Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ray Tracing results"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151894/7443" target="_top" id="2151894">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151894" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151894/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> We’re also upgrading the CPU to<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review" >Intel’s Core i5-14600KF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an overclockable processor that has 6 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores, 20 threads and a boost clock of 5.3 GHz.

So we’re going with an affordable 32GB kit from Crucial with a top speed of 5600 MT&#x2F;s.</p><p> We’re going with one of the best PCIe 4.0 SSDs you can buy, WD’s Black SN850X at 2TB.

Yes, AMD makes the Ryzen 9 7950X3D which is even faster overall, but it costs a lot more money and either ties or comes in behind the 7800X3D on many gaming tests.</p><p> On our suite of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/windows-11" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> tests, running at 1080p with an RTX 4090 card, the 7800X3D averaged 224 fps, putting it slightly ahead of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D (222 fps) and way ahead of Intel’s top-ranked Core i9-13900K (200 fps).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5TiEiPPHBkLtGTfkp3Tyh-320-80.png"                      alt="Ryzen 7 7800X3D 1080p gaming tests"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> To cool the CPU, we’re using an Iceberg Thermal IceFLOE Oasis 360. When we<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/liquid-cooling/iceberg-thermal-icefloe-oasis-360mm-240mm-review" >tested the IceFLOE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we were impressed with its low noise output and fantastic cooling output that allowed it to disperse up to 237 watts of heat. It has attractive RGB and you get all of that for a measly $89.</p><p> Our motherboard is Gigabyte B650M Aorus Elite AX which is one of the more affordable AM5 motherboards you can buy but it still packs in Wi-Fi 6E radio. AMD Zen 7000 chips require DDR5 RAM so we’re going with 32GB of G.Skill Trident Z5. The Trident Z5 kit tops our list of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ram,4057.html" >best RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , thanks to its tight-timings, fast performance and overclocking potential.

This is made possible thanks to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review" >Nvidia RTX 4090 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> card, which is by far the fastest card on the market — and also the most expensive, by an equally large margin.  </p><p> This is our dream machine build, so price is a lesser consideration on parts like the 4090, but the good news is prices are starting to come down. Not long ago, 4090 cards cost over $2,000, even though the Founder’s Edition RTX 4090 card carries a $1,599 MSRP. Right now, you can find one for under $1,800.</p><p> On our tests, the RTX 4090 averaged 112 fps playing a suite of games at 4K. That’s a huge improvement over the next-best card, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which only hit 90 fps. In ray tracing, the gap widens a lot more, with the 4090 averaging 58 fps, the 4080 sits at 41 fps, and the fastest card from AMD, the 7900 XTX, gets just 30 fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKv5emaUBYKBRQ8URPsxCY-320-80.png"                      alt="RTX 4090 Performance"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> Our CPU is AMD’s Ryzen 9 7950X3D, which offers faster gaming than any Intel CPU on the market, including the Core i9-14900K. It has a whopping 140MB of cache, thanks to AMDs innovative 3D V-Cache and it boasts 16 full-power cores and 32 threads, which is more regular cores than the 13900K’s set of 8 (to go with 16 E-Cores).</p><p> On our tests, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D beat Intel’s flagship, the 14900K by a full 21 fps on our 1440p suite of gaming tests. The cheaper, Ryzen 7 7800X3D is also really good at gaming, but does have as many cores for productivity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DiWoGh9Fc2ovFWFiYuJeuG-320-80.png"                      alt="Ryzen 7 7950X3D Charts"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> We’re using an Asus ROG Strix X670E-E motherboard, which comes with built-in Wi-Fi 6E, four M.2 slots for storage and 18+2 power stages. To cool the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, we’re using a 360mm Lian-Li Galahad II Trinity 360mm AIO. When we<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/lian-li-galahad-ii-performance-360" >reviewed the Galahad II <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we found that it had the absolute best performance of any all-in-one cooler we’ve ever tested.</p><p> Because we’re fattening our budget for this build, we’re going with some speedy DRAM in the form of G.Skill’s Trident Z5 RGB DDR5 , which operates at up to 6,400 MHz. In our<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gskill-trident-z5-rgb-ddr5-6400-c32-review" >review of the G.Skill Trident Z5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we lauded the kit’s strong performance and excellent overclockability. In our table, we are linking to a 32GB kit (2 x 16GB DIMMs as that is the highest capacity it is sold in. However, we recommend buying two of these kits so you can have 64GB of RAM.  </p><p> We’re going with a 4TB Samsung 990 Pro, which has plenty of capacity and is the fastest PCIe 4.0 drive you can buy. Sure, we can go up to a PCIe 5.0 drive but we don’t see enough performance gains to justify one, even in this high end build right now.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GArKvY8BSc22ZhDRwWyr2C-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Samsung 990 Pro 4TB Benchmarks"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> We decided to go with a case that has a unique, premium look in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/fractal-design-north-xl-review" >Fractal Design North XL. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> With its wood paneled front, this chassis looks more like a mid-century modern piece of furniture than a gaming PC, which is a nice subtle touch. However, it also has a tempered glass side panel which you can use to show off all of your RGB components (or you can buy it with a solid panel and no window). It also has fantastic thermal performance and plenty of room for more drives and fans. The XL model can accommodate up to an E-ATX motherboard, giving you plenty of room for future upgrades.</p><p> With these high-end components, we don’t want to skimp on the power supply, and having something that’s fit for a future graphics card upgrade makes sense. We’re going with a full 1000-watts of power and the Corsair HX1000. This power supply is 80+ Platinum certified and fully modular.</p><h2 id="Finding-Discounts-on-the-Best-PC-Components"><a href="#Finding-Discounts-on-the-Best-PC-Components" class="headerlink" title="Finding Discounts on the Best PC Components"></a>Finding Discounts on the Best PC Components</h2><p> To find savings on components of all types, check out our lists of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech" >best PC hardware deals <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , along with the latest<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.tomshardware.com/coupons/newegg.com" >Newegg promo codes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/coupons/corsair.com" >Corsair coupon codes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.tomshardware.com/coupons/bestbuy.com" >Best Buy promo codes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-bite-size-flavors-top-eating-moments-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Bite-Size Flavors Top Eating Moments on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-trending-rap-anthems-from-tiktok-stars/"><u>[New] In 2024, Trending Rap Anthems From TikTok Stars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-tiktok-a-mac-users-quickstart-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering TikTok A Mac User's Quickstart List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ideal-video-displays-the-best-5-for-playstation-5/"><u>2024 Approved Ideal Video Displays The Best 5 for PlayStation 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-erase-iphone-14-pro-max-when-its-locked-within-seconds-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Erase iPhone 14 Pro Max When Its Locked Within Seconds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/breaking-the-mold-unique-anime-creatives-dominating-tiktok/"><u>Breaking the Mold Unique Anime Creatives Dominating TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-craft-an-original-tiktok-tag-identifier-for-2024/"><u>How to Craft an Original TikTok Tag Identifier for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/24-the-science-of-captivating-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>In 2024, The Science of Captivating YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/mastering-social-interaction-on-the-go-connect-and-catch-up-using-apple-watch-features/"><u>Mastering Social Interaction on the Go: Connect and Catch Up Using Apple Watch Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/the-perfect-technology-arsenal-unveiling-the-9-imperative-devices-every-student-requires-for-education/"><u>The Perfect Technology Arsenal: Unveiling the 9 Imperative Devices Every Student Requires for Education</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-professional-results-without-the-professionals-diy-movie-making-for-beginners-for-2024/"><u>Updated Professional Results Without the Professionals DIY Movie Making for Beginners for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It does not just let you share your talent and creativity; you can also create a big fandom by having millions of followers. While the app has built-in presets and effects, the good news is that you can edit the videos using great computer software. And directly upload it to your TikTok account from your system.</p><p>Yes, you heard that right! You can download TikTok or any other Android application using the emulator BlueStacks.

TikTok is a passive pastime for the majority of us. You don’t have to hunt for videos; they find you as you <strong>accidentally refreshed TikTok</strong>. If you’ve ever attempted to use the search function to discover anything other than a particular author, you’ve probably had a difficult time. On your “For You” tab, you’ll sometimes see a video that sticks out from the others. It’s difficult to discover it again if you forgot to like it or accidentally refreshed your “For You” page. There are just too many videos on the site for you to have a chance of finding one in particular, particularly if the video is related to a popular subject.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Find-Videos-You-Have-Seen-When-Accidentally-Refreshed"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Find-Videos-You-Have-Seen-When-Accidentally-Refreshed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Find Videos You Have Seen When Accidentally Refreshed"></a>Part 1. How to Find Videos You Have Seen When Accidentally Refreshed</h2><p>TikTok is a bottomless hole of addiction, with each video algorithmically crafted to your preferences and interests. Astonishingly, losing only one of the countless important videos flashing past your face is such a tragedy. But it is; there is no greater annoyance than watching a video and then unintentionally refreshing your feed and seeing it go forever. So, <strong>what to do if you accidentally refreshed TikTok</strong>? Let’s find out the solutions available here. Unless you know where to look for it.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Find-Videos-in-Liked-If-You-Have-Liked-the-Videos"><a href="#Method-1-Find-Videos-in-Liked-If-You-Have-Liked-the-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.

This filter only displays search results for videos you’ve seen, which is a mind-boggling choice if you’re like me. I had no idea TikTok was keeping track of such videos. When you applied the filter, though, my video was the first to appear. After years of using software that simply erases these victims of the refresh button from existence, it seems a bit strange, but it works.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-4.jpg"                      alt="Set Filters"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-to-Do-to-Prevent-Video-Loss-When-Accidentally-Refreshed"><a href="#Part-2-What-to-Do-to-Prevent-Video-Loss-When-Accidentally-Refreshed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It was the first in its category to include a feature that allows users to express their creative ideas via short movies of up to a minute in length. Creators may also leverage TikTok Videos’ built-in capabilities to make their material even more interesting and appealing. You may also learn how to use TikTok Videos to create slow-motion effects.

You should now see TikTok content from the people you’ve selected to follow. You’ll find it on the for you tab if you’re seeking material from folks you haven’t followed yet (FYP). The for you page is ideal if you want to lose yourself in hours of material. All you have to do is swipe, and fresh stuff will display on your screen. You can also favorite any video by long-pressing it or clicking the share symbol and then “Add to Favorites.” By selecting the “Bookmark” symbol in the profile area, you may access all of your favorite videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/what-if-i-accidentally-refreshed-tiktok-5.jpg"                      alt="Add to Favorites"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Refresh-TikTok-Manually"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Refresh-TikTok-Manually" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Use the search box at the top of the Discover tab to seek subjects you’re interested in. TikTok gave me all the top videos for “Science” when I initially put it into the search field. I could have browsed through the choices for users, hashtags, and more if I wanted to learn more.</p><p>This strategy is a simple way to locate a range of videos with distinct hashtags and music, as opposed to looking at popular sounds and themes.

After all, they’re just a few seconds of a clip at the end of your videos. Why not just let the video end and move on?</p><p>Well, TikTok outros are actually a really important part of the platform. They’re a great way to promote your other social media platforms, give your viewers a call to action, or just show off your personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-outros-for-tiktok.png"                      alt="create outros for tiktok"                ></p><p>In this article, we’ll show you how to <strong>create an outro for TikTok</strong> that is sure to leave an ever-lasting impression on those watching your content. In the end, we’ll recommend the best video editors that you can use to make your videos engaging by creating the perfect outros every time.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Things-You-Should-Know-About-the-Outro-in-a-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Things-You-Should-Know-About-the-Outro-in-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video"></a>Part 1. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video</h2><p>The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.</p><p>An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.</p><p>Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it’s important to make it count!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png"                      alt="outros template"                ></p><h3 id="Elements-of-an-Outro"><a href="#Elements-of-an-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an Outro"></a>Elements of an Outro</h3><p>Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:</p><ul><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it’s released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.</li><li><strong>The Next Video to Watch:</strong> If you have other episodes&#x2F;parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.</li><li><strong>Your Social Media Channels:</strong> Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.</li><li><strong>Use Stunning Visuals:</strong> Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.</li></ul><h3 id="How-To-Make-an-Advanced-Good-Outro"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-Advanced-Good-Outro" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?"></a>How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?</h3><p>If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.</p><p>To <strong>create a good outro for your TikTok</strong>, follow the below tips:</p><ul><li>Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.</li><li>Keep your outro short and sweet because you don’t want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.</li><li>Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.</li><li>Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and&#x2F;or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.</li><li>Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.</li><li>Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-An-Excellent-Video-Editor-for-Your-TikTok-Adventure"><a href="#Part-2-An-Excellent-Video-Editor-for-Your-TikTok-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It capitalized on people’s shortened attention spans and focused on short-form videos to provide entertainment. Also, it provided people with an easy road to fame and with a solid side hustle.</p><p>Are you one of those who aspire to be TikTok’s future top-earner? Try making videos using <strong>TikTok video templates</strong>! They’ll allow you to churn out high-quality content faster than the competition. In this article, you will learn more about TikTok videos. Furthermore, we’ll introduce you to the 5 best places from where you can find great TikTok video templates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-template.gif"                      alt="use templates to create tiktok videos"                ></p><p>Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos</p><p>TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for “bite-sized” content turn to this platform for entertainment.</p><p>The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.</p><p>An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-Templates-To-Make-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Why-Use-Templates-To-Make-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?"></a>Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?</h2><p>The competition on TikTok is tough. A content creator can publish multiple videos in one day because they’re short, as long as they have ideas. So, attracting views with your videos is challenging.</p><p>If you can’t keep up with how fast-paced other content creators are, you should ensure your videos are of high quality. But what if you run out of ideas?</p><p>That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.</p><h2 id="Where-To-Find-TikTok-Video-Templates"><a href="#Where-To-Find-TikTok-Video-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Where To Find TikTok Video Templates?"></a>Where To Find TikTok Video Templates?</h2><p>We have established how much Tiktok video templates can help you.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps.

However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer-3"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

A mix of lip sync videos, music, and micro-video content, TikTok is extremely popular with Gen Z. Over the years, TikTok has continued to enhance the user experience by adding new features, effects, and guidelines.</p><p>Text-to-speech is one of the newest features to be added to the popular platform and it provides an additional way to add something innovative to the video uploads. Announced in December 2020, <strong>text to speech on TikTok</strong> lets creators put their text over their videos and have a Siri-like voice read it out loud.</p><p>TikTok’s text-to-speech feature was added to make the platform accessible to more people by providing an easy way for text to be heard as well as read. Consequently, using this option in video creation is one way that content creators can ensure their videos appeal to a larger number of viewers, while also offering a more comprehensive experience in general.</p><p>Since its launch, the feature has been going viral. Many find the automated voice to be a selling point in itself and something that adds a different element to the content. Also, it is a great way to get a message across without actually speaking during the video. No matter the reason it is used, the fact that many are turning to text-to-speech makes it a great addition to TikTok.</p><p>Wondering how to get the text to speech on TikTok for your next video? Here’s a detailed insight into this new feature.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Customize the Text-To-Speech Voice On TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Text-To-Speech-Feature-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?"></a>Part 1: What is the Text-To-Speech Feature On TikTok?</h2><p>In December 2020, TikTok began rolling out a new text-to-speech feature that automatically turns text into a voiceover as users watch videos that have the feature enabled. The popular social media platform included the new option as an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision, a growing trend for apps integrating voice technology.</p><p>Simply put, text to speech on TikTok allows video content creators to convert any piece of text they put on top of their video into a Siri-sounding voice. This means that whatever you type will be read out loud in a robotic tone, eliminating the need for you to narrate. It is a useful way to explain your videos to add context, describe what’s happening, or serve the purpose you see fit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/text-to-speech-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="text-to-speech tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: dexerto.com</p><p>There are numerous reasons why you might decide to use this option. Firstly, it’s a great alternative for users who can’t or don’t want to use their own voice in videos. Perhaps you’re shy or just wish to keep an air of anonymity. Or, you might have a speech impediment, or communicate non-vocally or non-verbally. Either way, this feature offers a great alternative way to narrate to viewers.</p><p>Also, there are several benefits this feature provides to the audience. Some of your viewers may have poor eye-sight, might struggle to read, or are blind. Using text to speech on TikTok will help you make sure that they can still interact with your video.</p><p>Making your video more accessible means that you will get better engagement, which is a win-win situation for you. Lastly, many TikTokers use the text-to-speech option for comedic or dramatic effects.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happened-to-TikTok-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?"></a>Part 2: What Happened to TikTok Text-To-Speech?</h2><p>Recently, TikTok changed the voice on its text-to-speech feature to a new, more energetic, and upbeat voice. This is because of a lawsuit filed by professional voice actor Beverley Standing against ByteDance – the parent company of TikTok. Standing had sued ByteDance in mid-May for using her voice in the text-to-speech setting without her permission.</p><p>The lawsuit of the voice actor states that she was hired to work in 2018 for the state-backed Chinese Institute Of Acoustics research body to use in translations and that TikTok has used them without paying her and it has caused damage. She said she hadn’t authorized the use of her voice beyond the use for translations.</p><p>The lawsuit concerns the English-language voice used in North America. TikTok videos made prior to the change still feature the old tone. Although TikTok is yet to comment on the new voice or Standing’s lawsuit, the timing of the changes is very suggestive.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Text-To-Speech-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?"></a>Part 3: How to Use Text-To-Speech On TikTok?</h2><p>Are you puzzled about how to get text to speech on TikTok? Check out the step-by-step guide below without any further ado!</p><h4 id="Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version"><a href="#Step-1-Update-Your-TikTok-to-The-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version"></a>Step 1: Update Your TikTok to The Latest Version</h4><p>First things first, ensure your TikTok is updated to the latest version so that you have the TikTok text-to-speech function. Many people have the natural human tendency to push updates as far as technologically possible. But, if you are perplexed about how to do text to speech on TikTok, ensure you have the latest version of this social media app before anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/latest-version-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="latest version tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording a Video"></a>Step 2: Start Recording a Video</h4><p>Take into account what you wish to say beforehand and have a rough idea of how quickly you want it to be read as the text to speech entry can be as long as your video. After you have the video recording you want to add the text over, press the checkmark on the lower right-hand corner of your app’s screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/start-record-video-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="start-record video tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Enter-Your-Text"><a href="#Step-3-Enter-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Enter Your Text"></a>Step 3: Enter Your Text</h4><p>Next, tap the text icon at the bottom of your screen and type the text you’d like to be read aloud. Ensure you keep in mind the length. Once you have entered the text, tap ‘<strong>Done</strong>’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will insert a customizable text box over your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/enter-text-tiktok.png"                      alt="enter text tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Step-4-Tap-On-the-Text-Choose-Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech"></a>Step 4: Tap On the Text, Choose Text-To-Speech</h4><p>When it comes to using text to speech on TikTok, this is another crucial step.Once you enter the text into the TikTok video, tap the Textbox and you will have three options: Text-to-Speech, Set Duration, and Edit. Select Text-to-Speech and the inbuilt text-to-speech AI of TikTok will read your text over the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tap-text-to-speech-tiktok.png"                      alt="tap-text-to speech tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally"><a href="#Step-5-Save-the-Video-Locally" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Save the Video Locally"></a>Step 5: Save the Video Locally</h4><p>It is here that you will venture outside TikTok to change the text-to-speech voice. Once your video is ready in every other way, consider saving it locally on your device and not post it for everyone to see. Ensure the “<strong>Save to Device</strong>” option is active and you can post it privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-to-device-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="save-to device tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers"><a href="#Step-6-Download-A-Video-Editor-with-Voice-Modifiers" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers"></a>Step 6: Download A Video Editor with Voice Modifiers</h4><p>Next, you have to download a video editor – ideally for your smartphone – with voice modifiers. Adding ‘video’ into the search keywords alongside ‘Voice Modifier’ or ‘Voice Changer’ will bring up a list of options. Remember; many voice changers or free editors will either block the option to save edited videos onto the device behind a paywall or leave a watermark.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave"><a href="#Step-7-Edit-the-Video-and-Resave" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave"></a>Step 7: Edit the Video and Resave</h4><p>Once you have chosen your video editor, launch it and import your saved TikTok video. Here, you can edit the audio just like any other video, and voice modifiers can be applied if the video editing tool you choose has them. Apply different effects you’d like and resave your new and modified TikTok video to your device.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok"><a href="#Step-8-Upload-as-A-New-Video-to-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok"></a>Step 8: Upload as A New Video to TikTok</h4><p>Open the TikTok app and upload the new, edited TikTok as a singular video directly, without any further edits.

You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134494/18498" target="_top" id="2134494">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134494" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134494/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-3-30-TikTok-Bio-Ideas-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-30-TikTok-Bio-Ideas-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024"></a>Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024</h2><p>Light travels faster than sound.

One such trending way to access the large mass of people or making your messages reach more than expected followers is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using hashtags in social media platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. You might be amazed that though <strong>hashtags for TikTok</strong> or other social media platforms refer to just a symbol of hash (#) and concerned text or phrase, they hold enough weightage to attract more and more followers. Well, the mechanism is quite simple but useful as well. For example, in your message, if you use some popular hashtags, it will automatically refer to everyone discussing the topic worldwide. This way, you get numerous followers with the fantastic trick of using Hashtags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hashtags-in-social-media.jpg"                      alt="Hashtags in Socual Media"                ></p><p>Image Source: &lt;<a href="http://www.disruptivestatic.com>">www.disruptivestatic.com&gt;</a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is TikTok hashtag and why should you use hashtags?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What types of hashtags on TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to find the best TikTok hashtags to increase your post reach?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-TikTok-hashtag-and-why-should-you-use-hashtags"><a href="#What-is-TikTok-hashtag-and-why-should-you-use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="What is TikTok hashtag, and why should you use hashtags?"></a>What is TikTok hashtag, and why should you use hashtags?</h2><p>In simple terms, <strong>a hashtag for TikTok</strong> is a combination of words and numbers or short sentences mentioned after the hash symbol (#).</p><p>So are you a frequent user of TikTok application and wondering what are <strong>TikTok trending hashtags</strong>, ways to use them, and even why to use them? Please go through this guide, as it is the right approach to look out all the possible ways to make your post visible or post trending in the social media platform like TikTok.</p><p>Hashtags for TikTok are a mixture of the hash symbol (#) and either letters, words, or phrases without providing any space in between them. It works the same in TikTok as with other platforms like Instagram and used to promote your media content like videos you have posted in the TikTok. When you use a relevant hashtag, it will categorize your content and make that discoverable to all the interested users, whoever searches for the respective content or hashtag content over the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hashtags-in-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Hashtags in Tiktok"                ></p><p>Image Source: &lt;<a href="http://www.brandsynario.com>">www.brandsynario.com&gt;</a></p><p>The process is quite simple to use. See, whenever you create content or video, it may or may not visible or accessible to others. But, when you apply a hashtag with a particular word or phrase to it, then that video will be visible to all users looking for related categorized content on the internet.
