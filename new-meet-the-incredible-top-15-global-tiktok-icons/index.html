But how exactly can you do that? Well, don’t miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.</p>
<h3 id="1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio"><a href="#1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio" class="headerlink" title="1. Take a video with a trending song or audio"></a>1. Take a video with a trending song or audio</h3><p>First, you have to know what’s trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p>
<h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags"></a>2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags</h3><p>Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don’t forget to include some that depict your post’s content to avoid making it too irrelevant.</p>
<h3 id="3-Maintain-your-theme"><a href="#3-Maintain-your-theme" class="headerlink" title="3. Maintain your theme"></a>3. Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t ever settle on the quality of the video"></a>4. Don’t ever settle on the quality of the video</h3><p>Unlike other social media platforms, videos on TikTok are always of high quality. For you to stand out, make sure everything is close to perfect if it’s not perfect, and we’d like to recommend Wondershare Filmora to extract the most outstanding features out of the TikTok video.

But how exactly can you do that? Well, don’t miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.</p>

Take a video with a trending song or audio</h3><p>First, you have to know what’s trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p>
<h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-1"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags"></a>2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags</h3><p>Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don’t forget to include some that depict your post’s content to avoid making it too irrelevant.</p>
<h3 id="3-Maintain-your-theme-1"><a href="#3-Maintain-your-theme-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Maintain your theme"></a>3. Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-1"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p>

Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-2"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

But how exactly can you do that? Well, don’t miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.</p>
<h3 id="1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio-3"><a href="#1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Take a video with a trending song or audio"></a>1. Take a video with a trending song or audio</h3><p>First, you have to know what’s trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p>
<h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-3"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags"></a>2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags</h3><p>Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don’t forget to include some that depict your post’s content to avoid making it too irrelevant.</p>
<h3 id="3-Maintain-your-theme-3"><a href="#3-Maintain-your-theme-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Maintain your theme"></a>3. Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="4.
