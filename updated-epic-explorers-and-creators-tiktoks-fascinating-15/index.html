It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p>
<h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-2"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags"></a>2.

Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don’t forget to include some that depict your post’s content to avoid making it too irrelevant.</p>

Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-2"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

But how exactly can you do that? Well, don’t miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.</p>
<h3 id="1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio-3"><a href="#1-Take-a-video-with-a-trending-song-or-audio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Take a video with a trending song or audio"></a>1. Take a video with a trending song or audio</h3><p>First, you have to know what’s trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p>
<h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-3"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags"></a>2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags</h3><p>Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don’t forget to include some that depict your post’s content to avoid making it too irrelevant.</p>
<h3 id="3-Maintain-your-theme-3"><a href="#3-Maintain-your-theme-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Maintain your theme"></a>3. Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p>Corn ribs are very simple to make. You take a corn ear and vertically slice it into four long ribs. Make sure you are using the corn rib after you have cleaned all the silk and dirt from it. Next, you can brush some spices mixed it oil over it to add some flavor to the corn. You can add herbs, chili flakes, or honey glaze. Now the last step is cooking the corn. You may grill it, bake it or air-fry it. You can then top it off with some cilantro or cotija cheese.</p>

Pancake Cereal"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TToUMBEmsIk" >Pancake Cereal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>While Tiktok has introduced us to many new recipes, revamping and creating something new from old recipes has its own charm. One of these wholly redone recipes is the Pancake cereal introduced by The Naughty Fork. By combining two of our breakfast favorites, they brought us something magical.</p>
<p>The pancake cereal consists of bite-sized pancakes that are topped with maple syrup. All you need to do is make your pancake mixture and use a teaspoon to make bite-sized pancakes. You can pour the tiny pancakes into a bowl and enjoy them with your spoon rather than slicing them and getting your face dirty.</p>
<p>You can also upgrade this simple recipe by adding some fruits to your bowl, whipped cream, hazelnut spread, and create your delicious pancake cereal bowl. You can eat it as breakfast or a simple mid-day snack.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, these are the top ten viral TikTok food recipes. The best part about these recipes is that they are all effortless to make with simple and few ingredients. Whether it’s the “2 ingredient souffle” or the corn ribs, anyone with little cooking knowledge can make these recipes at home.</p>
<p>Other than that, TikTok recipes are a great place to learn and experiment. You will see people make delicious recipes from flavors you thought would never work. And if you still think the flavors don’t work, you can always create your own version of the recipe.</p>
<p>We hope you find these recipes interesting and try them at your home. Let us know which of these is your favorite!</p>
