It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don’t have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, “The Whoa” track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.</p>
<h3 id="2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-3"><a href="#2-Take-advantage-of-the-most-common-hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags"></a>2.

Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list.

Maintain your theme</h3><p>Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don’t keep on mixing themes.</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3"><a href="#4-Don’t-ever-settle-on-the-quality-of-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p>The newest editing options to make your TikTok videos stand out include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motion Tracking:</strong> Now, you can add a Hollywood-style effect to your video with the simple motion tracking feature by Filmora. The motion tracking icon is now right above the timeline. Just select an object or person to track and click the icon. As easy as that. Track an athlete on the race track or follow a ship in its journey.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Ducking:</strong> Fade or lower the background audio so that the dialogue you want to focus on stands out. Audio ducking introduces a dramatic effect to your video. Using this feature also ensures a professional outlook. The technique might seem sophisticated but is actually a one-click process. Just select the clip you want to audio-focus and click <strong>Adjust Audio</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Keyframing:</strong> Now, you can animate your videos by using pre-sets. If you want to customize your animations, you can do it in just a few taps. Rotate, zoom, or change the position of the video in any way you like.</li>
<li><strong>Color Matching:</strong> One of the most important editing features. One-click color match allows you to copy color from one video to another. This feature will give your clips a consistent look. You can even save a color-corrected template for further use.</li>
<li><strong>Dark&#x2F;Light Interface:</strong> It doesn’t matter what time of the day (or night) it is. Select the model that suits you.</li>
</ul>
